## Conclusion

The current curriculum covers **16.3% of the textbook** across **7 sections**, representing approximately **241 exercises** and **55 examples**. While this provides a solid foundation in integration techniques and introduces differential equations, significant gaps remain in applications (40-50% of typical exams) and sequences/series (core Calc 2 topics).

**Recommended next additions:**
