About Calculus Volume 2
Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus course, incorporating innovative features to
enhance student learning. The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand
how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. Due to the comprehensive nature of the material,
we are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 2 covers integration, differential
equations, sequences and series, and parametric equations and polar coordinates.
Coverage and Scope
Our Calculus Volume 2 textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general calculus courses nationwide. We
have worked to make calculus interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent
in the subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of Calculus have been developed and
arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students
have already learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of
each section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but work with them in ways that will be useful in later
courses and future careers. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from
mathematics educators dedicated to the project.

Pedagogical Foundation
Throughout Calculus Volume 2 you will find examples and exercises that present classical ideas and techniques as well as
modern applications and methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom experience on the part
of long-time calculus professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students.
Motivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology, ecology, business, and economics, as well as
areas of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. Student Projects in each chapter give students
opportunities to explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied mathematics, from showing that the number e is
irrational, to calculating the center of mass of the Grand Canyon Skywalk or the terminal speed of a skydiver. Chapter
Opening Applications pose problems that are solved later in the chapter, using the ideas covered in that chapter.
Problems include the hydraulic force against the Hoover Dam, and the comparison of the relative intensity of two
earthquakes. Definitions, Rules, and Theorems are highlighted throughout the text, including over 60 Proofs of
theorems.
Assessments That Reinforce Key Concepts
In-chapter Examples walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking
students to practice the skill with a “Check Your Learning” component. The book also includes assessments at the end of
each chapter so students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems. Many exercises are marked with a
[T] to indicate they are suitable for solution by technology, including calculators or Computer Algebra Systems (CAS).
Answers for selected exercises are available in the Answer Key at the back of the book.
Early or Late Transcendentals
Calculus Volume 2 is designed to accommodate both Early and Late Transcendental approaches to calculus. Exponential
and logarithmic functions are presented in Chapter 2. Integration of these functions is covered in Chapters 1 for
instructors who want to include them with other types of functions. These discussions, however, are in separate sections
that can be skipped for instructors who prefer to wait until the integral definitions are given before teaching the calculus
derivations of exponentials and logarithms.
Comprehensive Art Program
Our art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of concepts through clear and effective illustrations,
diagrams, and photographs.

Iceboats are a common sight on the lakes of Wisconsin and Minnesota on winter weekends. Iceboats are similar to
sailboats, but they are fitted with runners, or “skates,” and are designed to run over the ice, rather than on water.
Iceboats can move very quickly, and many ice boating enthusiasts are drawn to the sport because of the speed. Top
iceboat racers can attain speeds up to five times the wind speed. If we know how fast an iceboat is moving, we can use
integration to determine how far it travels. We revisit this question later in the chapter (see Example 1.27).
Determining distance from velocity is just one of many applications of integration. In fact, integrals are used in a wide
variety of mechanical and physical applications. In this chapter, we first introduce the theory behind integration and use
1 • Introduction


integrals to calculate areas. From there, we develop the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which relates differentiation
and integration. We then study some basic integration techniques and briefly examine some applications.

### 1.1 Approximating Areas Learning Objectives

1.1.1 Use sigma (summation) notation to calculate sums and powers of integers.
1.1.2 Use the sum of rectangular areas to approximate the area under a curve.
1.1.3 Use Riemann sums to approximate area.
Archimedes was fascinated with calculating the areas of various shapes—in other words, the amount of space enclosed
by the shape. He used a process that has come to be known as the method of exhaustion, which used smaller and
smaller shapes, the areas of which could be calculated exactly, to fill an irregular region and thereby obtain closer and
closer approximations to the total area. In this process, an area bounded by curves is filled with rectangles, triangles,
and shapes with exact area formulas. These areas are then summed to approximate the area of the curved region.
In this section, we develop techniques to approximate the area between a curve, defined by a function
and the
x-axis on a closed interval
Like Archimedes, we first approximate the area under the curve using shapes of known
area (namely, rectangles). By using smaller and smaller rectangles, we get closer and closer approximations to the area.
Taking a limit allows us to calculate the exact area under the curve.
Let’s start by introducing some notation to make the calculations easier. We then consider the case when
is
continuous and nonnegative. Later in the chapter, we relax some of these restrictions and develop techniques that apply
in more general cases.
Sigma (Summation) Notation
As mentioned, we will use shapes of known area to approximate the area of an irregular region bounded by curves. This
process often requires adding up long strings of numbers. To make it easier to write down these lengthy sums, we look
at some new notation here, called sigma notation (also known as summation notation). The Greek capital letter
sigma, is used to express long sums of values in a compact form. For example, if we want to add all the integers from 1
to 20 without sigma notation, we have to write
We could probably skip writing a couple of terms and write
which is better, but still cumbersome. With sigma notation, we write this sum as
which is much more compact.
Typically, sigma notation is presented in the form
where
describes the terms to be added, and the i is called the index. Each term is evaluated, then we sum all the
values, beginning with the value when
and ending with the value when
For example, an expression like
is interpreted as
Note that the index is used only to keep track of the terms to be
added; it does not factor into the calculation of the sum itself. The index is therefore called a dummy variable. We can
use any letter we like for the index. Typically, mathematicians use i, j, k, m, and n for indices.
Let’s try a couple of examples of using sigma notation.

Approximating Area
Now that we have the necessary notation, we return to the problem at hand: approximating the area under a curve. Let
be a continuous, nonnegative function defined on the closed interval
We want to approximate the area A
bounded by
above, the x-axis below, the line
on the left, and the line
on the right (Figure 1.2).

### 1.1 • Approximating Areas 9




*Figure 1.2 An area (shaded region) bounded by the curve*

at top, the x-axis at bottom, the line
to the left, and
the line
at right.
How do we approximate the area under this curve? The approach is a geometric one. By dividing a region into many
small shapes that have known area formulas, we can sum these areas and obtain a reasonable estimate of the true area.
We begin by dividing the interval
into n subintervals of equal width,
We do this by selecting equally spaced
points
with
and
for
We denote the width of each subinterval with the notation Δx, so
and
for
This notion of dividing an interval
into subintervals by selecting points from within the interval
is used quite often in approximating the area under a curve, so let’s define some relevant terminology.
Definition
A set of points
for
with
which divides the interval
into subintervals of the form
is called a partition of
If the subintervals all
have the same width, the set of points forms a regular partition of the interval
We can use this regular partition as the basis of a method for estimating the area under the curve. We next examine two
methods: the left-endpoint approximation and the right-endpoint approximation.
Rule: Left-Endpoint Approximation
On each subinterval
(for
construct a rectangle with width Δx and height equal to
which is the function value at the left endpoint of the subinterval. Then the area of this rectangle is
Adding the areas of all these rectangles, we get an approximate value for A (Figure 1.3). We use the notation Ln to
denote that this is a left-endpoint approximation of A using n subintervals.

*Figure 1.3 In the left-endpoint approximation of area under a curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the*

function value at the left of each subinterval.
The second method for approximating area under a curve is the right-endpoint approximation. It is almost the same as
the left-endpoint approximation, but now the heights of the rectangles are determined by the function values at the
right of each subinterval.
Rule: Right-Endpoint Approximation
Construct a rectangle on each subinterval
only this time the height of the rectangle is determined by the
function value
at the right endpoint of the subinterval. Then, the area of each rectangle is
and the
approximation for A is given by
The notation
indicates this is a right-endpoint approximation for A (Figure 1.4).

*Figure 1.4 In the right-endpoint approximation of area under a curve, the height of each rectangle is determined by the*

function value at the right of each subinterval. Note that the right-endpoint approximation differs from the left-endpoint
approximation in Figure 1.3.
The graphs in Figure 1.5 represent the curve
In graph (a) we divide the region represented by the interval

### 1.1 • Approximating Areas 11



into six subintervals, each of width 0.5. Thus,
We then form six rectangles by drawing vertical lines
perpendicular to
the left endpoint of each subinterval. We determine the height of each rectangle by calculating
for
The intervals are
We find the area of
each rectangle by multiplying the height by the width. Then, the sum of the rectangular areas approximates the area
between
and the x-axis. When the left endpoints are used to calculate height, we have a left-endpoint
approximation. Thus,

*Figure 1.5 Methods of approximating the area under a curve by using (a) the left endpoints and (b) the right endpoints.*

In Figure 1.5(b), we draw vertical lines perpendicular to
such that
is the right endpoint of each subinterval, and
calculate
for
We multiply each
by Δx to find the rectangular areas, and then add them. This
is a right-endpoint approximation of the area under
Thus,

**Solution:**

First, divide the interval
into n equal subintervals. Using

are shown in Figure 1.6. Using a left-endpoint approximation,

The right-endpoint approximation is shown in Figure 1.7. The intervals are the same,
but now use the right
endpoint to calculate the height of the rectangles. We have

*Figure 1.7 The graph shows the right-endpoint approximation of the area under*

The left-endpoint approximation is 1.75; the right-endpoint approximation is 3.75.

use
Approximate
the area using both methods.
Looking at Figure 1.5 and the graphs in Example 1.4, we can see that when we use a small number of intervals, neither
the left-endpoint approximation nor the right-endpoint approximation is a particularly accurate estimate of the area
under the curve. However, it seems logical that if we increase the number of points in our partition, our estimate of A will
improve. We will have more rectangles, but each rectangle will be thinner, so we will be able to fit the rectangles to the
curve more precisely.
We can demonstrate the improved approximation obtained through smaller intervals with an example. Let’s explore the
idea of increasing n, first in a left-endpoint approximation with four rectangles, then eight rectangles, and finally 32
rectangles. Then, let’s do the same thing in a right-endpoint approximation, using the same sets of intervals, of the same
curved region. Figure 1.8 shows the area of the region under the curve
on the interval
using a
left-endpoint approximation where
The width of each rectangle is
The area is approximated by the summed areas of the rectangles, or

### 1.1 • Approximating Areas 13




*Figure 1.8 With a left-endpoint approximation and dividing the region from a to b into four equal intervals, the area*

under the curve is approximately equal to the sum of the areas of the rectangles.

*Figure 1.9 shows the same curve divided into eight subintervals. Comparing the graph with four rectangles in Figure 1.8*

with this graph with eight rectangles, we can see there appears to be less white space under the curve when
This
white space is area under the curve we are unable to include using our approximation. The area of the rectangles is

Based on these figures and calculations, it appears we are on the right track; the rectangles appear to approximate the
area under the curve better as n gets larger. Furthermore, as n increases, both the left-endpoint and right-endpoint
approximations appear to approach an area of 8 square units. Table 1.1 shows a numerical comparison of the left- and
right-endpoint methods. The idea that the approximations of the area under the curve get better and better as n gets
larger and larger is very important, and we now explore this idea in more detail.

Forming Riemann Sums
So far we have been using rectangles to approximate the area under a curve. The heights of these rectangles have been
determined by evaluating the function at either the right or left endpoints of the subinterval
In reality, there
is no reason to restrict evaluation of the function to one of these two points only. We could evaluate the function at any
point
in the subinterval
and use
as the height of our rectangle. This gives us an estimate for the
area of the form
A sum of this form is called a Riemann sum, named for the 19th-century mathematician Bernhard Riemann, who
developed the idea.

Recall that with the left- and right-endpoint approximations, the estimates seem to get better and better as n get larger
and larger. The same thing happens with Riemann sums. Riemann sums give better approximations for larger values of
n. We are now ready to define the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums.

limit of a function
as x goes to infinity. Limits of sums are discussed in detail in the chapter on Sequences and
Series; however, for now we can assume that the computational techniques we used to compute limits of functions can
also be used to calculate limits of sums.

1.2.2 Explain the terms integrand, limits of integration, and variable of integration.
1.2.3 Explain when a function is integrable.
1.2.4 Describe the relationship between the definite integral and net area.
1.2.5 Use geometry and the properties of definite integrals to evaluate them.
1.2.6 Calculate the average value of a function.
In the preceding section we defined the area under a curve in terms of Riemann sums:
∞
However, this definition came with restrictions. We required
to be continuous and nonnegative. Unfortunately, realworld problems don’t always meet these restrictions. In this section, we look at how to apply the concept of the area
under the curve to a broader set of functions through the use of the definite integral.
Definition and Notation
The definite integral generalizes the concept of the area under a curve. We lift the requirements that
be continuous
and nonnegative, and define the definite integral as follows.
Definition
If
is a function defined on an interval
the definite integral of f from a to b is given by
provided the limit exists. If this limit exists, the function
is said to be integrable on
or is an integrable
function.
The integral symbol in the previous definition should look familiar. We have seen similar notation in the chapter on
Applications of Derivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-introduction), where we used the
indefinite integral symbol (without the a and b above and below) to represent an antiderivative. Although the notation
for indefinite integrals may look similar to the notation for a definite integral, they are not the same. A definite integral is
a number. An indefinite integral is a family of functions. Later in this chapter we examine how these concepts are related.
However, close attention should always be paid to notation so we know whether we’re working with a definite integral or
an indefinite integral.
Integral notation goes back to the late seventeenth century and is one of the contributions of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,
who is often considered to be the codiscoverer of calculus, along with Isaac Newton. The integration symbol ∫ is an
elongated S, suggesting sigma or summation. On a definite integral, above and below the summation symbol are the
boundaries of the interval,
The numbers a and b are x-values and are called the limits of integration; specifically,
a is the lower limit and b is the upper limit. To clarify, we are using the word limit in two different ways in the context of
the definite integral. First, we talk about the limit of a sum as
∞Second, the boundaries of the region are called the
limits of integration.
We call the function
the integrand, and the dx indicates that
is a function with respect to x, called the
variable of integration. Note that, like the index in a sum, the variable of integration is a dummy variable, and has no
impact on the computation of the integral. We could use any variable we like as the variable of integration:
Previously, we discussed the fact that if
is continuous on
then the limit

unique. This leads to the following theorem, which we state without proof.

#### Theorem 1.1: 

Continuous Functions Are Integrable
If
is continuous on
then f is integrable on
Functions that are not continuous on
may still be integrable, depending on the nature of the discontinuities. For
example, functions continuous on a closed interval, apart from a finite number of jump discontinuities, are integrable.
It is also worth noting here that we have retained the use of a regular partition in the Riemann sums. This restriction is
not strictly necessary. Any partition can be used to form a Riemann sum. However, if a nonregular partition is used to
define the definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we
must take the limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in
our limits and makes the calculations more difficult without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with
regular partitions for the Riemann sums.

#### Example 1.7: Evaluating an Integral Using the Definition

Use the definition of the definite integral to evaluate
Use a right-endpoint approximation to generate the
Riemann sum.

**Solution:**

We first want to set up a Riemann sum. Based on the limits of integration, we have

Then
Since we are using a right-endpoint approximation to generate Riemann sums, for each i, we need to calculate the
function value at the right endpoint of the interval

and since P is a
regular partition,
Thus, the function value at the right endpoint of the interval is
Then the Riemann sum takes the form

Evaluating Definite Integrals
Evaluating definite integrals this way can be quite tedious because of the complexity of the calculations. Later in this
chapter we develop techniques for evaluating definite integrals without taking limits of Riemann sums. However, for
now, we can rely on the fact that definite integrals represent the area under the curve, and we can evaluate definite
integrals by using geometric formulas to calculate that area. We do this to confirm that definite integrals do, indeed,
represent areas, so we can then discuss what to do in the case of a curve of a function dropping below the x-axis.

Use the formula for the area of a circle to evaluate

**Solution:**

The function describes a semicircle with radius 3. To find
we want to find the area under the curve over the interval
The formula for the area of a circle is

of a semicircle is just one-half the area of a circle, or

Use the formula for the area of a trapezoid to evaluate
Area and the Definite Integral
When we defined the definite integral, we lifted the requirement that
be nonnegative. But how do we interpret “the
area under the curve” when
is negative?
Net Signed Area
Let us return to the Riemann sum. Consider, for example, the function
(shown in Figure 1.17) on the
interval
Use
and choose
as the left endpoint of each interval. Construct a rectangle on each
subinterval of height
and width Δx. When
is positive, the product
represents the area of the
rectangle, as before. When
is negative, however, the product
represents the negative of the area of the
rectangle. The Riemann sum then becomes

*Figure 1.17 For a function that is partly negative, the Riemann sum is the area of the rectangles above the x-axis less the*

area of the rectangles below the x-axis.

### 1.2 • The Definite Integral 27



Taking the limit as
∞the Riemann sum approaches the area between the curve above the x-axis and the x-axis, less
the area between the curve below the x-axis and the x-axis, as shown in Figure 1.18. Then,
∞
The quantity
is called the net signed area.

*Figure 1.18 In the limit, the definite integral equals area A1 less area A2, or the net signed area.*

Notice that net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero. If the area above the x-axis is larger, the net signed area is
positive. If the area below the x-axis is larger, the net signed area is negative. If the areas above and below the x-axis are
equal, the net signed area is zero.

#### Example 1.9: Finding the Net Signed Area

Find the net signed area between the curve of the function
and the x-axis over the interval

**Solution:**

The function produces a straight line that forms two triangles: one from
to
and the other from
to
(Figure 1.19). Using the geometric formula for the area of a triangle,
the area of triangle A1, above the
axis, is
where 3 is the base and
is the height. The area of triangle A2, below the axis, is
where 3 is the base and 6 is the height. Thus, the net area is

Since the areas of the
two triangles are equal, the net area is zero.
1.9
Find the net signed area of

illustrated in the following image.
Total Area
One application of the definite integral is finding displacement when given a velocity function. If
represents the
velocity of an object as a function of time, then the area under the curve tells us how far the object is from its original
position. This is a very important application of the definite integral, and we examine it in more detail later in the chapter.
For now, we’re just going to look at some basics to get a feel for how this works by studying constant velocities.
When velocity is a constant, the area under the curve is just velocity times time. This idea is already very familiar. If a car
travels away from its starting position in a straight line at a speed of 70 mph for 2 hours, then it is 140 mi away from its
original position (Figure 1.20). Using integral notation, we have

### 1.2 • The Definite Integral 29




*Figure 1.20 The area under the curve*

tells us how far the car is from its starting point at a given time.
In the context of displacement, net signed area allows us to take direction into account. If a car travels straight north at a
speed of 60 mph for 2 hours, it is 120 mi north of its starting position. If the car then turns around and travels south at a
speed of 40 mph for 3 hours, it will be back at it starting position (Figure 1.21). Again, using integral notation, we have
In this case the displacement is zero.

*Figure 1.21 The area above the axis and the area below the axis are equal, so the net signed area is zero.*

Suppose we want to know how far the car travels overall, regardless of direction. In this case, we want to know the area
between the curve and the x-axis, regardless of whether that area is above or below the axis. This is called the total
area.
Graphically, it is easiest to think of calculating total area by adding the areas above the axis and the areas below the axis
(rather than subtracting the areas below the axis, as we did with net signed area). To accomplish this mathematically, we
use the absolute value function. Thus, the total distance traveled by the car is

Bringing these ideas together formally, we state the following definitions.

Properties of the Definite Integral
The properties of indefinite integrals apply to definite integrals as well. Definite integrals also have properties that relate
to the limits of integration. These properties, along with the rules of integration that we examine later in this chapter,
help us manipulate expressions to evaluate definite integrals.

A picture can sometimes tell us more about a function than the results of computations. Comparing functions by their
graphs as well as by their algebraic expressions can often give new insight into the process of integration. Intuitively, we
might say that if a function
is above another function
then the area between
and the x-axis is greater
than the area between
and the x-axis. This is true depending on the interval over which the comparison is made.
The properties of definite integrals are valid whether

only the case

Average Value of a Function
We often need to find the average of a set of numbers, such as an average test grade. Suppose you received the
following test scores in your algebra class: 89, 90, 56, 78, 100, and 69. Your semester grade is your average of test scores
and you want to know what grade to expect. We can find the average by adding all the scores and dividing by the
number of scores. In this case, there are six test scores. Thus,
Therefore, your average test grade is approximately 80.33, which translates to a B− at most schools.

Suppose, however, that we have a function
that gives us the speed of an object at any time t, and we want to find
the object’s average speed. The function
takes on an infinite number of values, so we can’t use the process just
described. Fortunately, we can use a definite integral to find the average value of a function such as this.

area formulas and limits of Riemann sums, and both approaches are extremely cumbersome. In this section we look at
some more powerful and useful techniques for evaluating definite integrals.
These new techniques rely on the relationship between differentiation and integration. This relationship was discovered
and explored by both Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (among others) during the late 1600s and early

1700s, and it is codified in what we now call the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which has two parts that we
examine in this section. Its very name indicates how central this theorem is to the entire development of calculus.
MEDIA
Isaac Newton’s contributions to mathematics and physics changed the way we look at the world. The relationships
he discovered, codified as Newton’s laws and the law of universal gravitation, are still taught as foundational
material in physics today, and his calculus has spawned entire fields of mathematics. To learn more, read a brief
biography (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_newtonbio) of Newton with multimedia clips.
Before we get to this crucial theorem, however, let’s examine another important theorem, the Mean Value Theorem for
Integrals, which is needed to prove the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that a continuous function on a closed interval takes on its average value
at some point in that interval. The theorem guarantees that if
is continuous, a point c exists in an interval
such that the value of the function at c is equal to the average value of
over
We state this theorem
mathematically with the help of the formula for the average value of a function that we presented at the end of the
preceding section.

#### Theorem 1.3: 

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals
If

This formula can also be stated as

such that

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1: Integrals and Antiderivatives
As mentioned earlier, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is an extremely powerful theorem that establishes the
relationship between differentiation and integration, and gives us a way to evaluate definite integrals without using
Riemann sums or calculating areas. The theorem is comprised of two parts, the first of which, the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, Part 1, is stated here. Part 1 establishes the relationship between differentiation and integration.

#### Theorem 1.4: 

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1
If

and the function
is defined by
then
over
Before we delve into the proof, a couple of subtleties are worth mentioning here. First, a comment on the notation. Note
that we have defined a function,
as the definite integral of another function,
from the point a to the point x.
(1.16)

### 1.3 • The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus 43



At first glance, this is confusing, because we have said several times that a definite integral is a number, and here it looks
like it’s a function. The key here is to notice that for any particular value of x, the definite integral is a number. So the
function
returns a number (the value of the definite integral) for each value of x.
Second, it is worth commenting on some of the key implications of this theorem. There is a reason it is called the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Not only does it establish a relationship between integration and differentiation, but
also it guarantees that any integrable function has an antiderivative.
Proof
Applying the definition of the derivative, we have
Looking carefully at this last expression, we see
is just the average value of the function
over the
interval
Therefore, by The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals, there is some number c in
such that
In addition, since c is between x and x + h, c approaches x as h approaches zero. Also, since
is continuous, we have
Putting all these pieces together, we have
and the proof is complete.

Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2: The Evaluation Theorem
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, is perhaps the most important theorem in calculus. After tireless efforts
by mathematicians for approximately 500 years, new techniques emerged that provided scientists with the necessary
tools to explain many phenomena. Using calculus, astronomers could finally determine distances in space and map
planetary orbits. Everyday financial problems such as calculating marginal costs or predicting total profit could now be
handled with simplicity and accuracy. Engineers could calculate the bending strength of materials or the threedimensional motion of objects. Our view of the world was forever changed with calculus.
After finding approximate areas by adding the areas of n rectangles, the application of this theorem is straightforward by
comparison. It almost seems too simple that the area of an entire curved region can be calculated by just evaluating an
antiderivative at the first and last endpoints of an interval.

#### Theorem 1.5: 

The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2
If f is continuous over the interval
and
is any antiderivative of
then
We often see the notation
to denote the expression
We use this vertical bar and associated limits a
and b to indicate that we should evaluate the function
at the upper limit (in this case, b), and subtract the value of
the function
evaluated at the lower limit (in this case, a).
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 (also known as the evaluation theorem) states that if we can find an
antiderivative for the integrand, then we can evaluate the definite integral by evaluating the antiderivative at the
endpoints of the interval and subtracting.
Proof
Let
be a regular partition of
Then, we can write

Recall the power rule for Antiderivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-10-antiderivatives):
Use this rule to find the antiderivative of the function and then apply the theorem. We have
Analysis
Notice that we did not include the “+ C” term when we wrote the antiderivative. The reason is that, according to the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2, any antiderivative works. So, for convenience, we chose the antiderivative with
If we had chosen another antiderivative, the constant term would have canceled out. This always happens when
evaluating a definite integral.
The region of the area we just calculated is depicted in Figure 1.28. Note that the region between the curve and the
x-axis is all below the x-axis. Area is always positive, but a definite integral can still produce a negative number (a net
signed area). For example, if this were a profit function, a negative number indicates the company is operating at a loss
over the given interval.

after 5 sec wins a prize. If James can skate at a velocity of
ft/sec and Kathy can skate at a velocity of
ft/sec, who is going to win the race?

**Solution:**

We need to integrate both functions over the interval

Using the power rule, we have
Thus, James has skated 50 ft after 5 sec. Turning now to Kathy, we want to calculate

STUDENT PROJECT
A Parachutist in Free Fall

*Figure 1.30 Skydivers can adjust the velocity of their dive by changing the position of their body during the free fall.*

(credit: Jeremy T. Lock)
Julie is an avid skydiver. She has more than 300 jumps under her belt and has mastered the art of making
adjustments to her body position in the air to control how fast she falls. If she arches her back and points her belly
toward the ground, she reaches a terminal velocity of approximately 120 mph (176 ft/sec). If, instead, she orients her
body with her head straight down, she falls faster, reaching a terminal velocity of 150 mph (220 ft/sec).
Since Julie will be moving (falling) in a downward direction, we assume the downward direction is positive to simplify
our calculations. Julie executes her jumps from an altitude of 12,500 ft. After she exits the aircraft, she immediately
starts falling at a velocity given by
She continues to accelerate according to this velocity function until she
reaches terminal velocity. After she reaches terminal velocity, her speed remains constant until she pulls her ripcord
and slows down to land.
On her first jump of the day, Julie orients herself in the slower “belly down” position (terminal velocity is 176 ft/sec).
Using this information, answer the following questions.
1.
How long after she exits the aircraft does Julie reach terminal velocity?
2.
Based on your answer to question 1, set up an expression involving one or more integrals that represents the
distance Julie falls after 30 sec.
3.
If Julie pulls her ripcord at an altitude of 3000 ft, how long does she spend in a free fall?
4.
Julie pulls her ripcord at 3000 ft. It takes 5 sec for her parachute to open completely and for her to slow down,
during which time she falls another 400 ft. After her canopy is fully open, her speed is reduced to 16 ft/sec. Find
the total time Julie spends in the air, from the time she leaves the airplane until the time her feet touch the
ground.
On Julie’s second jump of the day, she decides she wants to fall a little faster and orients herself in the “head
down” position. Her terminal velocity in this position is 220 ft/sec. Answer these questions based on this velocity:
5.
How long does it take Julie to reach terminal velocity in this case?

when her parachute opens. If she begins this maneuver at an altitude of 4000 ft, how long does she spend in a
free fall before beginning the reorientation?
Some jumpers wear “wingsuits” (see Figure 1.31). These suits have fabric panels between the arms and legs and
allow the wearer to glide around in a free fall, much like a flying squirrel. (Indeed, the suits are sometimes called
“flying squirrel suits.”) When wearing these suits, terminal velocity can be reduced to about 30 mph (44 ft/sec),
allowing the wearers a much longer time in the air. Wingsuit flyers still use parachutes to land; although the
vertical velocities are within the margin of safety, horizontal velocities can exceed 70 mph, much too fast to land
safely.

1.4.2 Explain the significance of the net change theorem.
1.4.3 Use the net change theorem to solve applied problems.
1.4.4 Apply the integrals of odd and even functions.
In this section, we use some basic integration formulas studied previously to solve some key applied problems. It is
important to note that these formulas are presented in terms of indefinite integrals. Although definite and indefinite
integrals are closely related, there are some key differences to keep in mind. A definite integral is either a number (when
the limits of integration are constants) or a single function (when one or both of the limits of integration are variables).
An indefinite integral represents a family of functions, all of which differ by a constant. As you become more familiar with
integration, you will get a feel for when to use definite integrals and when to use indefinite integrals. You will naturally
select the correct approach for a given problem without thinking too much about it. However, until these concepts are
cemented in your mind, think carefully about whether you need a definite integral or an indefinite integral and make
sure you are using the proper notation based on your choice.
Basic Integration Formulas
Recall the integration formulas given in the table in Antiderivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/
4-10-antiderivatives) and the rule on properties of definite integrals. Let’s look at a few examples of how to apply these
rules.

#### Example 1.23: Integrating a Function Using the Power Rule

Use the power rule to integrate the function

**Solution:**

The first step is to rewrite the function and simplify it so we can apply the power rule:
Now apply the power rule:

Find the definite integral of
over the interval
The Net Change Theorem
The net change theorem considers the integral of a rate of change. It says that when a quantity changes, the new value
equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change of that quantity. The formula can be expressed in two ways.
The second is more familiar; it is simply the definite integral.

#### Theorem 1.6: 

Net Change Theorem
The new value of a changing quantity equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change:
Subtracting
from both sides of the first equation yields the second equation. Since they are equivalent formulas,
which one we use depends on the application.
The significance of the net change theorem lies in the results. Net change can be applied to area, distance, and volume,
to name only a few applications. Net change accounts for negative quantities automatically without having to write more
than one integral. To illustrate, let’s apply the net change theorem to a velocity function in which the result is
displacement.
We looked at a simple example of this in The Definite Integral. Suppose a car is moving due north (the positive direction)
at 40 mph between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., then the car moves south at 30 mph between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. We can graph this
motion as shown in Figure 1.32.

*Figure 1.32 The graph shows speed versus time for the given motion of a car.*

Just as we did before, we can use definite integrals to calculate the net displacement as well as the total distance
traveled. The net displacement is given by
(1.18)

### 1.4 • Integration Formulas and the Net Change Theorem 57



Thus, at 5 p.m. the car is 50 mi north of its starting position. The total distance traveled is given by
Therefore, between 2 p.m. and 5 p.m., the car traveled a total of 110 mi.
To summarize, net displacement may include both positive and negative values. In other words, the velocity function
accounts for both forward distance and backward distance. To find net displacement, integrate the velocity function over
the interval. Total distance traveled, on the other hand, is always positive. To find the total distance traveled by an object,
regardless of direction, we need to integrate the absolute value of the velocity function.

#### Example 1.24: Finding Net Displacement

Given a velocity function
(in meters per second) for a particle in motion from time
to time
find
the net displacement of the particle.

**Solution:**

Applying the net change theorem, we have
The net displacement is
m (Figure 1.33).

*Figure 1.33 The graph shows velocity versus time for a particle moving with a linear velocity function.*


#### Example 1.25: Finding the Total Distance Traveled

Use Example 1.24 to find the total distance traveled by a particle according to the velocity function
m/sec
over a time interval

**Solution:**

The total distance traveled includes both the positive and the negative values. Therefore, we must integrate the absolute
value of the velocity function to find the total distance traveled.
To continue with the example, use two integrals to find the total distance. First, find the t-intercept of the function, since
that is where the division of the interval occurs. Set the equation equal to zero and solve for t. Thus,
The two subintervals are
and
To find the total distance traveled, integrate the absolute value of the
function. Since the function is negative over the interval
we have
over that interval. Over
the function is positive, so
Thus, we have

### 1.4 • Integration Formulas and the Net Change Theorem 59



So, the total distance traveled is
m.
1.22
Find the net displacement and total distance traveled in meters given the velocity function
over the interval
Applying the Net Change Theorem
The net change theorem can be applied to the flow and consumption of fluids, as shown in Example 1.26.

#### Example 1.26: How Many Gallons of Gasoline Are Consumed?

If the motor on a motorboat is started at
and the boat consumes gasoline at the rate of
gal/hr, how much
gasoline is used in the first 2 hours?

**Solution:**

Express the problem as a definite integral, integrate, and evaluate using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. The
limits of integration are the endpoints of the interval
We have
Thus, the motorboat uses 9.6 gal of gas in 2 hours.

#### Example 1.27: Chapter Opener: Iceboats


*Figure 1.34 (credit: modification of work by Carter Brown, Flickr)*

As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, top iceboat racers (Figure 1.1) can attain speeds of up to five times the wind
speed. Andrew is an intermediate iceboater, though, so he attains speeds equal to only twice the wind speed. Suppose
Andrew takes his iceboat out one morning when a light 5-mph breeze has been blowing all morning. As Andrew gets his
iceboat set up, though, the wind begins to pick up. During his first half hour of iceboating, the wind speed increases
according to the function
For the second half hour of Andrew’s outing, the wind remains steady at 15

mph. In other words, the wind speed is given by
Recalling that Andrew’s iceboat travels at twice the wind speed, and assuming he moves in a straight line away from his
starting point, how far is Andrew from his starting point after 1 hour?

**Solution:**

To figure out how far Andrew has traveled, we need to integrate his velocity, which is twice the wind speed. Then
Distance
Substituting the expressions we were given for
we get
Andrew is 25 mi from his starting point after 1 hour.
1.23
Suppose that, instead of remaining steady during the second half hour of Andrew’s outing, the wind starts
to die down according to the function
In other words, the wind speed is given by
Under these conditions, how far from his starting point is Andrew after 1 hour?
Integrating Even and Odd Functions
We saw in Functions and Graphs (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/1-introduction) that an even
function is a function in which
for all x in the domain—that is, the graph of the curve is unchanged when
x is replaced with −x. The graphs of even functions are symmetric about the y-axis. An odd function is one in which
for all x in the domain, and the graph of the function is symmetric about the origin.
Integrals of even functions, when the limits of integration are from −a to a, involve two equal areas, because they are
symmetric about the y-axis. Integrals of odd functions, when the limits of integration are similarly
evaluate to
zero because the areas above and below the x-axis are equal.
Rule: Integrals of Even and Odd Functions
For continuous even functions such that
For continuous odd functions such that

### 1.4 • Integration Formulas and the Net Change Theorem 61




#### Example 1.28: Integrating an Even Function

Integrate the even function
and verify that the integration formula for even functions holds.

**Solution:**

The symmetry appears in the graphs in Figure 1.35. Graph (a) shows the region below the curve and above the x-axis. We
have to zoom in to this graph by a huge amount to see the region. Graph (b) shows the region above the curve and
below the x-axis. The signed area of this region is negative. Both views illustrate the symmetry about the y-axis of an
even function. We have
To verify the integration formula for even functions, we can calculate the integral from 0 to 2 and double it, then check to
make sure we get the same answer.
Since
we have verified the formula for even functions in this particular example.

### 1.5 Substitution Learning Objectives

1.5.1 Use substitution to evaluate indefinite integrals.
1.5.2 Use substitution to evaluate definite integrals.
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gave us a method to evaluate integrals without using Riemann sums. The
drawback of this method, though, is that we must be able to find an antiderivative, and this is not always easy. In this
section we examine a technique, called integration by substitution, to help us find antiderivatives. Specifically, this
method helps us find antiderivatives when the integrand is the result of a chain-rule derivative.
At first, the approach to the substitution procedure may not appear very obvious. However, it is primarily a visual
task—that is, the integrand shows you what to do; it is a matter of recognizing the form of the function. So, what are we
supposed to see? We are looking for an integrand of the form
For example, in the integral

we have
and
Then,
and we see that our integrand is in the correct form.
The method is called substitution because we substitute part of the integrand with the variable u and part of the
integrand with du. It is also referred to as change of variables because we are changing variables to obtain an
expression that is easier to work with for applying the integration rules.

#### Theorem 1.7: 

Substitution with Indefinite Integrals
Let

and let

Then,
Proof
Let f, g, u, and F be as specified in the theorem. Then
Integrating both sides with respect to x, we see that
If we now substitute
and
we get

Returning to the problem we looked at originally, we let
and then
Rewrite the integral in terms of
u:
Using the power rule for integrals, we have
Substitute the original expression for x back into the solution:
We can generalize the procedure in the following Problem-Solving Strategy.

2.

3.
We should now be able to evaluate the integral with respect to u. If the integral can’t be evaluated we need to go
back and select a different expression to use as u.
4.
Evaluate the integral in terms of u.
5.
Write the result in terms of x and the expression

#### Example 1.30: Using Substitution to Find an Antiderivative

Use substitution to find the antiderivative

**Solution:**

The first step is to choose an expression for u. We choose
because then
and we already have du
in the integrand. Write the integral in terms of u:
Remember that du is the derivative of the expression chosen for u, regardless of what is inside the integrand. Now we
can evaluate the integral with respect to u:
Analysis
We can check our answer by taking the derivative of the result of integration. We should obtain the integrand. Picking a
value for C of 1, we let
We have
so
This is exactly the expression we started with inside the integrand.

### 1.5 • Substitution 77



1.27
Use substitution to evaluate the integral
Sometimes we need to manipulate an integral in ways that are more complicated than just multiplying or dividing by a
constant. We need to eliminate all the expressions within the integrand that are in terms of the original variable. When
we are done, u should be the only variable in the integrand. In some cases, this means solving for the original variable in
terms of u. This technique should become clear in the next example.

#### Example 1.33: Finding an Antiderivative Using u-Substitution

Use substitution to find the antiderivative

**Solution:**

If we let
then
But this does not account for the x in the numerator of the integrand. We need to
express x in terms of u. If

Now we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:
Then we integrate in the usual way, replace u with the original expression, and factor and simplify the result. Thus,
1.28
Use substitution to evaluate the indefinite integral
Substitution for Definite Integrals
Substitution can be used with definite integrals, too. However, using substitution to evaluate a definite integral requires a
change to the limits of integration. If we change variables in the integrand, the limits of integration change as well.

Substitution may be only one of the techniques needed to evaluate a definite integral. All of the properties and rules of
integration apply independently, and trigonometric functions may need to be rewritten using a trigonometric identity
before we can apply substitution. Also, we have the option of replacing the original expression for u after we find the
antiderivative, which means that we do not have to change the limits of integration. These two approaches are shown in

### 1.6 • Integrals Involving Exponential and Logarithmic Functions 83



Exponential and logarithmic functions are used to model population growth, cell growth, and financial growth, as well as
depreciation, radioactive decay, and resource consumption, to name only a few applications. In this section, we explore
integration involving exponential and logarithmic functions.
Integrals of Exponential Functions
The exponential function is perhaps the most efficient function in terms of the operations of calculus. The exponential
function,
is its own derivative and its own integral.
Rule: Integrals of Exponential Functions
Exponential functions can be integrated using the following formulas.

#### Example 1.37: Finding an Antiderivative of an Exponential Function

Find the antiderivative of the exponential function e−x.

**Solution:**

Use substitution, setting
and then
Multiply the du equation by −1, so you now have
Then,

Find the antiderivative of the function using substitution:
A common mistake when dealing with exponential expressions is treating the exponent on e the same way we treat
exponents in polynomial expressions. We cannot use the power rule for the exponent on e. This can be especially
confusing when we have both exponentials and polynomials in the same expression, as in the previous checkpoint. In
these cases, we should always double-check to make sure we’re using the right rules for the functions we’re integrating.

#### Example 1.38: Square Root of an Exponential Function

Here we choose to let u equal the expression in the exponent on e. Let

Again, du is off by a
constant multiplier; the original function contains a factor of 3x2, not 6x2. Multiply both sides of the equation by
so
that the integrand in u equals the integrand in x. Thus,
Integrate the expression in u and then substitute the original expression in x back into the u integral:
1.33
Evaluate the indefinite integral
As mentioned at the beginning of this section, exponential functions are used in many real-life applications. The number
e is often associated with compounded or accelerating growth, as we have seen in earlier sections about the derivative.
Although the derivative represents a rate of change or a growth rate, the integral represents the total change or the total
growth. Let’s look at an example in which integration of an exponential function solves a common business application.
A price–demand function tells us the relationship between the quantity of a product demanded and the price of the
product. In general, price decreases as quantity demanded increases. The marginal price–demand function is the
derivative of the price–demand function and it tells us how fast the price changes at a given level of production. These
functions are used in business to determine the price–elasticity of demand, and to help companies determine whether
changing production levels would be profitable.

#### Example 1.40: Finding a Price–Demand Equation

Find the price–demand equation for a particular brand of toothpaste at a supermarket chain when the demand is 50
tubes per week at $2.35 per tube, given that the marginal price—demand function,
for x number of tubes per
week, is given as

### 1.6 • Integrals Involving Exponential and Logarithmic Functions 85



If the supermarket chain sells 100 tubes per week, what price should it set?

**Solution:**

To find the price–demand equation, integrate the marginal price–demand function. First find the antiderivative, then
look at the particulars. Thus,
Using substitution, let
and
Then, divide both sides of the du equation by −0.01. This gives
The next step is to solve for C. We know that when the price is $2.35 per tube, the demand is 50 tubes per week. This
means
Now, just solve for C:
Thus,
If the supermarket sells 100 tubes of toothpaste per week, the price would be
The supermarket should charge $1.99 per tube if it is selling 100 tubes per week.

Let

### 1.7 Integrals Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions Learning Objectives

1.7.1 Integrate functions resulting in inverse trigonometric functions
In this section we focus on integrals that result in inverse trigonometric functions. We have worked with these functions
before. Recall from Functions and Graphs (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/1-introduction) that
trigonometric functions are not one-to-one unless the domains are restricted. When working with inverses of
trigonometric functions, we always need to be careful to take these restrictions into account. Also in Derivatives
(http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/3-introduction), we developed formulas for derivatives of inverse
trigonometric functions. The formulas developed there give rise directly to integration formulas involving inverse
trigonometric functions.
Integrals that Result in Inverse Sine Functions
Let us begin this last section of the chapter with the three formulas. Along with these formulas, we use substitution to
evaluate the integrals. We prove the formula for the inverse sine integral.

Integrals Resulting in Other Inverse Trigonometric Functions
There are six inverse trigonometric functions. However, only three integration formulas are noted in the rule on
integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions because the remaining three are negative versions of
the ones we use. The only difference is whether the integrand is positive or negative. Rather than memorizing three
more formulas, if the integrand is negative, simply factor out −1 and evaluate the integral using one of the formulas
already provided. To close this section, we examine one more formula: the integral resulting in the inverse tangent
function.

#### Key Concepts


### 1.1 Approximating Areas •

The use of sigma (summation) notation of the form
is useful for expressing long sums of values in compact
form.
•
For a continuous function defined over an interval
the process of dividing the interval into n equal parts,
extending a rectangle to the graph of the function, calculating the areas of the series of rectangles, and then
summing the areas yields an approximation of the area of that region.
•
The width of each rectangle is
•
Riemann sums are expressions of the form
and can be used to estimate the area under the curve
1 • Chapter Review


Left- and right-endpoint approximations are special kinds of Riemann sums where the values of
are
chosen to be the left or right endpoints of the subintervals, respectively.
•
Riemann sums allow for much flexibility in choosing the set of points
at which the function is evaluated, often
with an eye to obtaining a lower sum or an upper sum.

### 1.2 The Definite Integral •

The definite integral can be used to calculate net signed area, which is the area above the x-axis less the area below
the x-axis. Net signed area can be positive, negative, or zero.
•
The component parts of the definite integral are the integrand, the variable of integration, and the limits of
integration.
•
Continuous functions on a closed interval are integrable. Functions that are not continuous may still be integrable,
depending on the nature of the discontinuities.
•
The properties of definite integrals can be used to evaluate integrals.
•
The area under the curve of many functions can be calculated using geometric formulas.
•
The average value of a function can be calculated using definite integrals.

### 1.3 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus •

The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals states that for a continuous function over a closed interval, there is a value c
such that
equals the average value of the function. See The Mean Value Theorem for Integrals.
•
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1 shows the relationship between the derivative and the integral. See
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 1.
•
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Part 2 is a formula for evaluating a definite integral in terms of an
antiderivative of its integrand. The total area under a curve can be found using this formula. See The Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, Part 2.

### 1.4 Integration Formulas and the Net Change Theorem •

The net change theorem states that when a quantity changes, the final value equals the initial value plus the
integral of the rate of change. Net change can be a positive number, a negative number, or zero.
•
The area under an even function over a symmetric interval can be calculated by doubling the area over the positive
x-axis. For an odd function, the integral over a symmetric interval equals zero, because half the area is negative.

### 1.5 Substitution •

Substitution is a technique that simplifies the integration of functions that are the result of a chain-rule derivative.
The term ‘substitution’ refers to changing variables or substituting the variable u and du for appropriate expressions
in the integrand.
•
When using substitution for a definite integral, we also have to change the limits of integration.

### 1.6 Integrals Involving Exponential and Logarithmic Functions •

Exponential and logarithmic functions arise in many real-world applications, especially those involving growth and
decay.
•
Substitution is often used to evaluate integrals involving exponential functions or logarithms.

### 1.7 Integrals Resulting in Inverse Trigonometric Functions •

Formulas for derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions developed in Derivatives of Exponential and Logarithmic
Functions (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/3-7-derivatives-of-inverse-functions) lead directly to
integration formulas involving inverse trigonometric functions.
•
Use the formulas listed in the rule on integration formulas resulting in inverse trigonometric functions to match up
the correct format and make alterations as necessary to solve the problem.
•
Substitution is often required to put the integrand in the correct form.

The Hoover Dam is an engineering marvel. When Lake Mead, the reservoir behind the dam, is full, the dam withstands a
great deal of force. However, water levels in the lake vary considerably as a result of droughts and varying water
demands. Later in this chapter, we use definite integrals to calculate the force exerted on the dam when the reservoir is
full and we examine how changing water levels affect that force (see Example 2.28).
Hydrostatic force is only one of the many applications of definite integrals we explore in this chapter. From geometric
applications such as surface area and volume, to physical applications such as mass and work, to growth and decay
models, definite integrals are a powerful tool to help us understand and model the world around us.

area between two curves that are functions of

### 2.2 Determining Volumes by Slicing Learning Objectives

2.2.1 Determine the volume of a solid by integrating a cross-section (the slicing method).
2.2.2 Find the volume of a solid of revolution using the disk method.
2.2.3 Find the volume of a solid of revolution with a cavity using the washer method.
In the preceding section, we used definite integrals to find the area between two curves. In this section, we use definite
integrals to find volumes of three-dimensional solids. We consider three approaches—slicing, disks, and washers—for
finding these volumes, depending on the characteristics of the solid.
Volume and the Slicing Method
Just as area is the numerical measure of a two-dimensional region, volume is the numerical measure of a threedimensional solid. Most of us have computed volumes of solids by using basic geometric formulas. The volume of a
rectangular solid, for example, can be computed by multiplying length, width, and height:
The formulas for the
volume of a sphere
a cone
and a pyramid
have also been introduced.
Although some of these formulas were derived using geometry alone, all these formulas can be obtained by using
integration.
We can also calculate the volume of a cylinder. Although most of us think of a cylinder as having a circular base, such as a
soup can or a metal rod, in mathematics the word cylinder has a more general meaning. To discuss cylinders in this
more general context, we first need to define some vocabulary.
We define the cross-section of a solid to be the intersection of a plane with the solid. A cylinder is defined as any solid
that can be generated by translating a plane region along a line perpendicular to the region, called the axis of the
cylinder. Thus, all cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder are identical. The solid shown in Figure 2.11 is an
example of a cylinder with a noncircular base. To calculate the volume of a cylinder, then, we simply multiply the area of
the cross-section by the height of the cylinder:
In the case of a right circular cylinder (soup can), this becomes

### 2.2 • Determining Volumes by Slicing 119




*Figure 2.11 Each cross-section of a particular cylinder is identical to the others.*

If a solid does not have a constant cross-section (and it is not one of the other basic solids), we may not have a formula
for its volume. In this case, we can use a definite integral to calculate the volume of the solid. We do this by slicing the
solid into pieces, estimating the volume of each slice, and then adding those estimated volumes together. The slices
should all be parallel to one another, and when we put all the slices together, we should get the whole solid. Consider, for
example, the solid S shown in Figure 2.12, extending along the

*Figure 2.12 A solid with a varying cross-section.*

We want to divide
into slices perpendicular to the
As we see later in the chapter, there may be times when we
want to slice the solid in some other direction—say, with slices perpendicular to the y-axis. The decision of which way to
slice the solid is very important. If we make the wrong choice, the computations can get quite messy. Later in the
chapter, we examine some of these situations in detail and look at how to decide which way to slice the solid. For the
purposes of this section, however, we use slices perpendicular to the

one is not provided.

However, the problem-solving strategy shown here is valid regardless of
how we choose to slice the solid.

**Solution:**

We want to apply the slicing method to a pyramid with a square base. To set up the integral, consider the pyramid shown

*Figure 2.14 (a) A pyramid with a square base is oriented along the x-axis. (b) A two-dimensional view of the pyramid is*

seen from the side.
We first want to determine the shape of a cross-section of the pyramid. We know the base is a square, so the crosssections are squares as well (step 1). Now we want to determine a formula for the area of one of these cross-sectional
squares. Looking at Figure 2.14(b), and using a proportion, since these are similar triangles, we have

Solids of Revolution
If a region in a plane is revolved around a line in that plane, the resulting solid is called a solid of revolution, as shown in

The Washer Method
Some solids of revolution have cavities in the middle; they are not solid all the way to the axis of revolution. Sometimes,
this is just a result of the way the region of revolution is shaped with respect to the axis of revolution. In other cases,
cavities arise when the region of revolution is defined as the region between the graphs of two functions. A third way
this can happen is when an axis of revolution other than the
or
is selected.
When the solid of revolution has a cavity in the middle, the slices used to approximate the volume are not disks, but
washers (disks with holes in the center). For example, consider the region bounded above by the graph of the function
and below by the graph of the function
over the interval
When this region is revolved
around the
the result is a solid with a cavity in the middle, and the slices are washers. The graph of the function
and a representative washer are shown in Figure 2.22(a) and (b). The region of revolution and the resulting solid are

### 2.3 Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells Learning Objectives

2.3.1 Calculate the volume of a solid of revolution by using the method of cylindrical shells.
2.3.2 Compare the different methods for calculating a volume of revolution.
In this section, we examine the method of cylindrical shells, the final method for finding the volume of a solid of
revolution. We can use this method on the same kinds of solids as the disk method or the washer method; however, with
the disk and washer methods, we integrate along the coordinate axis parallel to the axis of revolution. With the method
of cylindrical shells, we integrate along the coordinate axis perpendicular to the axis of revolution. The ability to choose
which variable of integration we want to use can be a significant advantage with more complicated functions. Also, the
specific geometry of the solid sometimes makes the method of using cylindrical shells more appealing than using the
washer method. In the last part of this section, we review all the methods for finding volume that we have studied and
lay out some guidelines to help you determine which method to use in a given situation.
The Method of Cylindrical Shells
Again, we are working with a solid of revolution. As before, we define a region
bounded above by the graph of a
function
below by the

and
respectively, as shown in

*Figure 2.25(a). We then revolve this region around the y-axis, as shown in Figure 2.25(b). Note that this is different from*

what we have done before. Previously, regions defined in terms of functions of
were revolved around the
or a
line parallel to it.

*Figure 2.27 Calculating the volume of the shell.*

The shell is a cylinder, so its volume is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the height of the cylinder. The cross-sections
are annuli (ring-shaped regions—essentially, circles with a hole in the center), with outer radius
and inner radius
Thus, the cross-sectional area is
The height of the cylinder is

is both the midpoint of the interval
and the average radius of the shell, and we can
approximate this by
We then have
Another way to think of this is to think of making a vertical cut in the shell and then opening it up to form a flat plate
(Figure 2.28).

*Figure 2.28 (a) Make a vertical cut in a representative shell. (b) Open the shell up to form a flat plate.*


### 2.3 • Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells 139



In reality, the outer radius of the shell is greater than the inner radius, and hence the back edge of the plate would be
slightly longer than the front edge of the plate. However, we can approximate the flattened shell by a flat plate of height
width
and thickness
(Figure 2.28). The volume of the shell, then, is approximately the volume of the flat
plate. Multiplying the height, width, and depth of the plate, we get
which is the same formula we had before.
To calculate the volume of the entire solid, we then add the volumes of all the shells and obtain
Here we have another Riemann sum, this time for the function

### 2.4 Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area Learning Objectives

2.4.1 Determine the length of a curve,
between two points.
2.4.2 Determine the length of a curve,
between two points.
2.4.3 Find the surface area of a solid of revolution.
In this section, we use definite integrals to find the arc length of a curve. We can think of arc length as the distance you
would travel if you were walking along the path of the curve. Many real-world applications involve arc length. If a rocket
is launched along a parabolic path, we might want to know how far the rocket travels. Or, if a curve on a map represents
a road, we might want to know how far we have to drive to reach our destination.
We begin by calculating the arc length of curves defined as functions of
then we examine the same process for curves
defined as functions of
(The process is identical, with the roles of
and
reversed.) The techniques we use to find arc
length can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of revolution, and we close the section with an examination
of this concept.
Arc Length of the Curve y = f(x)
In previous applications of integration, we required the function
to be integrable, or at most continuous. However,
for calculating arc length we have a more stringent requirement for
Here, we require
to be differentiable, and
furthermore we require its derivative,
to be continuous. Functions like this, which have continuous derivatives, are
called smooth. (This property comes up again in later chapters.)
Let

Although it might seem logical to use either horizontal or vertical line segments, we want our
line segments to approximate the curve as closely as possible. Figure 2.37 depicts this construct for

*Figure 2.37 We can approximate the length of a curve by adding line segments.*

To help us find the length of each line segment, we look at the change in vertical distance as well as the change in
horizontal distance over each interval. Because we have used a regular partition, the change in horizontal distance over
each interval is given by
The change in vertical distance varies from interval to interval, though, so we use
to represent the change in vertical distance over the interval
as shown in Figure 2.38.
Note that some (or all)
may be negative.

*Figure 2.38 A representative line segment approximates the curve over the interval*

By the Pythagorean theorem, the length of the line segment is
We can also write this as

such that
Then the length of the line segment is given by
Adding up the lengths of all
the line segments, we get

Area of a Surface of Revolution
The concepts we used to find the arc length of a curve can be extended to find the surface area of a surface of
revolution. Surface area is the total area of the outer layer of an object. For objects such as cubes or bricks, the surface
area of the object is the sum of the areas of all of its faces. For curved surfaces, the situation is a little more complex. Let

Notice that when each line segment is revolved around the axis, it produces a band. These bands are actually pieces of
cones (think of an ice cream cone with the pointy end cut off). A piece of a cone like this is called a frustum of a cone.
To find the surface area of the band, we need to find the lateral surface area,
of the frustum (the area of just the
slanted outside surface of the frustum, not including the areas of the top or bottom faces). Let
and
be the radii of
the wide end and the narrow end of the frustum, respectively, and let
be the slant height of the frustum as shown in
the following figure.

*Figure 2.42 A frustum of a cone can approximate a small part of surface area.*

We know the lateral surface area of a cone is given by
where
is the radius of the base of the cone and

*Figure 2.43 The lateral surface area of the cone is given by*

Since a frustum can be thought of as a piece of a cone, the lateral surface area of the frustum is given by the lateral
surface area of the whole cone less the lateral surface area of the smaller cone (the pointy tip) that was cut off (see the
following figure).

*Figure 2.44 Calculating the lateral surface area of a frustum of a cone.*

The cross-sections of the small cone and the large cone are similar triangles, so we see that

In this section, we examine some physical applications of integration. Let’s begin with a look at calculating mass from a
density function. We then turn our attention to work, and close the section with a study of hydrostatic force.
Mass and Density
We can use integration to develop a formula for calculating mass based on a density function. First we consider a thin
rod or wire. Orient the rod so it aligns with the
with the left end of the rod at
and the right end of the rod at
(Figure 2.48). Note that although we depict the rod with some thickness in the figures, for mathematical purposes
we assume the rod is thin enough to be treated as a one-dimensional object.

*Figure 2.48 We can calculate the mass of a thin rod oriented along the*

by integrating its density function.
If the rod has constant density
given in terms of mass per unit length, then the mass of the rod is just the product of
the density and the length of the rod:
If the density of the rod is not constant, however, the problem becomes a
little more challenging. When the density of the rod varies from point to point, we use a linear density function,
to
denote the density of the rod at any point,
Let
be an integrable linear density function. Now, for

*Figure 2.49 shows a representative segment of the rod.*

The mass
of the segment of the rod from

is approximated by
Adding the masses of all the segments gives us an approximation for the mass of the entire rod:

This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as
∞we get an expression for the exact mass of the rod:
∞
We state this result in the following theorem.

#### Theorem 2.7: 

Mass–Density Formula of a One-Dimensional Object
Given a thin rod oriented along the
over the interval
let
denote a linear density function giving the
density of the rod at a point x in the interval. Then the mass of the rod is given by
We apply this theorem in the next example.

#### Example 2.23: Calculating Mass from Linear Density

Consider a thin rod oriented on the x-axis over the interval
If the density of the rod is given by
what is the mass of the rod?

**Solution:**

Applying Equation 2.10 directly, we have
2.23
Consider a thin rod oriented on the x-axis over the interval
If the density of the rod is given by
what is the mass of the rod?
We now extend this concept to find the mass of a two-dimensional disk of radius
As with the rod we looked at in the
one-dimensional case, here we assume the disk is thin enough that, for mathematical purposes, we can treat it as a twodimensional object. We assume the density is given in terms of mass per unit area (called area density), and further
assume the density varies only along the disk’s radius (called radial density). We orient the disk in the
with the
center at the origin. Then, the density of the disk can be treated as a function of

Now, use the partition to break up the disk into thin (two-dimensional) washers. A disk and a representative washer are
depicted in the following figure.

*Figure 2.50 (a) A thin disk in the xy-plane. (b) A representative washer.*

We now approximate the density and area of the washer to calculate an approximate mass,
Note that the area of the
washer is given by
You may recall that we had an expression similar to this when we were computing volumes by shells. As we did there, we
use
to approximate the average radius of the washer. We obtain
Using
to approximate the density of the washer, we approximate the mass of the washer by
Adding up the masses of the washers, we see the mass
of the entire disk is approximated by

We summarize these findings in the following theorem.

Work Done by a Force
We now consider work. In physics, work is related to force, which is often intuitively defined as a push or pull on an
object. When a force moves an object, we say the force does work on the object. In other words, work can be thought of
as the amount of energy it takes to move an object. According to physics, when we have a constant force, work can be
expressed as the product of force and distance.
In the English system, the unit of force is the pound and the unit of distance is the foot, so work is given in foot-pounds.
In the metric system, kilograms and meters are used. One newton is the force needed to accelerate
kilogram of mass
at the rate of
m/sec2. Thus, the most common unit of work is the newton-meter. This same unit is also called the joule.
Both are defined as kilograms times meters squared over seconds squared
When we have a constant force, things are pretty easy. It is rare, however, for a force to be constant. The work done to
compress (or elongate) a spring, for example, varies depending on how far the spring has already been compressed (or
stretched). We look at springs in more detail later in this section.
Suppose we have a variable force
that moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis from point
to point
To calculate the work done, we partition the interval
and estimate the work done over each subinterval. So, for
let
be a regular partition of the interval
and for
choose an arbitrary point
To calculate the work done to move an object from point
to point
we assume the force is
roughly constant over the interval, and use
to approximate the force. The work done over the interval
then, is given by
Therefore, the work done over the interval
is approximately
Taking the limit of this expression as
∞gives us the exact value for work:
∞
Thus, we can define work as follows.
Definition
If a variable force
moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis from point a to point b, then the work
done on the object is
Note that if F is constant, the integral evaluates to
which is the formula we stated at the beginning of

### 2.5 • Physical Applications 165



this section.
Now let’s look at the specific example of the work done to compress or elongate a spring. Consider a block attached to a
horizontal spring. The block moves back and forth as the spring stretches and compresses. Although in the real world we
would have to account for the force of friction between the block and the surface on which it is resting, we ignore friction
here and assume the block is resting on a frictionless surface. When the spring is at its natural length (at rest), the
system is said to be at equilibrium. In this state, the spring is neither elongated nor compressed, and in this equilibrium
position the block does not move until some force is introduced. We orient the system such that
corresponds to
the equilibrium position (see the following figure).

*Figure 2.51 A block attached to a horizontal spring at equilibrium, compressed, and elongated.*

According to Hooke’s law, the force required to compress or stretch a spring from an equilibrium position is given by
for some constant
The value of
depends on the physical characteristics of the spring. The constant
is
called the spring constant and is always positive. We can use this information to calculate the work done to compress or
elongate a spring, as shown in the following example.

#### Example 2.25: The Work Required to Stretch or Compress a Spring

Suppose it takes a force of

Work Done in Pumping
Consider the work done to pump water (or some other liquid) out of a tank. Pumping problems are a little more
complicated than spring problems because many of the calculations depend on the shape and size of the tank. In
addition, instead of being concerned about the work done to move a single mass, we are looking at the work done to
move a volume of water, and it takes more work to move the water from the bottom of the tank than it does to move the
water from the top of the tank.
We examine the process in the context of a cylindrical tank, then look at a couple of examples using tanks of different
shapes. Assume a cylindrical tank of radius
m and height
m is filled to a depth of 8 m. How much work does it take
to pump all the water over the top edge of the tank?
The first thing we need to do is define a frame of reference. We let
represent the vertical distance below the top of the
tank. That is, we orient the
vertically, with the origin at the top of the tank and the downward direction being
positive (see the following figure).

*Figure 2.52 How much work is needed to empty a tank partially filled with water?*

Using this coordinate system, the water extends from
to
Therefore, we partition the interval
and
look at the work required to lift each individual “layer” of water. So, for
let

of the interval
and for

*Figure 2.53 shows a*

representative layer.

*Figure 2.53 A representative layer of water.*

In pumping problems, the force required to lift the water to the top of the tank is the force required to overcome gravity,
so it is equal to the weight of the water. Given that the weight-density of water is
N/m3, or
lb/ft3, calculating
the volume of each layer gives us the weight. In this case, we have
Then, the force needed to lift each layer is
Note that this step becomes a little more difficult if we have a noncylindrical tank. We look at a noncylindrical tank in the
next example.

### 2.5 • Physical Applications 167



We also need to know the distance the water must be lifted. Based on our choice of coordinate systems, we can use
as an approximation of the distance the layer must be lifted. Then the work to lift the
layer of water
is
approximately
Adding the work for each layer, we see the approximate work to empty the tank is given by
This is a Riemann sum, so taking the limit as
∞we get
∞
The work required to empty the tank is approximately 23,650,000 J.
For pumping problems, the calculations vary depending on the shape of the tank or container. The following problemsolving strategy lays out a step-by-step process for solving pumping problems.
Problem-Solving Strategy
Solving Pumping Problems
1.
Sketch a picture of the tank and select an appropriate frame of reference.
2.
Calculate the volume of a representative layer of water.
3.

4.
Calculate the distance the layer of water must be lifted.
5.
Multiply the force and distance to get an estimate of the work needed to lift the layer of water.
6.
Sum the work required to lift all the layers. This expression is an estimate of the work required to pump out the
desired amount of water, and it is in the form of a Riemann sum.
7.
Take the limit as
∞and evaluate the resulting integral to get the exact work required to pump out the
desired amount of water.
We now apply this problem-solving strategy in an example with a noncylindrical tank.

water is pumped over the upper edge of the tank until the height of the water remaining in the tank is

**Solution:**

A tank is in the shape of an inverted cone, with height
ft and base radius 6 ft. The tank is filled to a
depth of 8 ft to start with, and water is pumped over the upper edge of the tank until 3 ft of water remain
in the tank. How much work is required to pump out that amount of water?
Hydrostatic Force and Pressure
In this last section, we look at the force and pressure exerted on an object submerged in a liquid. In the English system,
force is measured in pounds. In the metric system, it is measured in newtons. Pressure is force per unit area, so in the
English system we have pounds per square foot (or, perhaps more commonly, pounds per square inch, denoted psi). In
the metric system we have newtons per square meter, also called pascals.
Let’s begin with the simple case of a plate of area
submerged horizontally in water at a depth s (Figure 2.56). Then, the
force exerted on the plate is simply the weight of the water above it, which is given by
where
is the weight
density of water (weight per unit volume). To find the hydrostatic pressure—that is, the pressure exerted by water on a
submerged object—we divide the force by the area. So the pressure is
2 • Applications of Integration

*Figure 2.56 A plate submerged horizontally in water.*

By Pascal’s principle, the pressure at a given depth is the same in all directions, so it does not matter if the plate is
submerged horizontally or vertically. So, as long as we know the depth, we know the pressure. We can apply Pascal’s
principle to find the force exerted on surfaces, such as dams, that are oriented vertically. We cannot apply the formula
directly, because the depth varies from point to point on a vertically oriented surface. So, as we have done
many times before, we form a partition, a Riemann sum, and, ultimately, a definite integral to calculate the force.
Suppose a thin plate is submerged in water. We choose our frame of reference such that the x-axis is oriented vertically,
with the downward direction being positive, and point
corresponding to a logical reference point. Let
denote
the depth at point x. Note we often let
correspond to the surface of the water. In this case, depth at any point is
simply given by
However, in some cases we may want to select a different reference point for
so we
proceed with the development in the more general case. Last, let
denote the width of the plate at the point

The partition divides the plate into several thin, rectangular strips (see the following figure).

*Figure 2.57 A thin plate submerged vertically in water.*

Let’s now estimate the force on a representative strip. If the strip is thin enough, we can treat it as if it is at a constant
depth,
We then have
Adding the forces, we get an estimate for the force on the plate:
This is a Riemann sum, so taking the limit gives us the exact force. We obtain

Evaluating this integral gives us the force on the plate. We summarize this in the following problem-solving strategy.

We now return our attention to the Hoover Dam, mentioned at the beginning of this chapter. The actual dam is arched,

When the reservoir is full, Lake Mead’s maximum depth is about 530 ft, and the surface of the lake is about 10 ft below

### 2.6 Moments and Centers of Mass Learning Objectives

2.6.1 Find the center of mass of objects distributed along a line.
2.6.2 Locate the center of mass of a thin plate.
2.6.3 Use symmetry to help locate the centroid of a thin plate.
2.6.4 Apply the theorem of Pappus for volume.
In this section, we consider centers of mass (also called centroids, under certain conditions) and moments. The basic
idea of the center of mass is the notion of a balancing point. Many of us have seen performers who spin plates on the
ends of sticks. The performers try to keep several of them spinning without allowing any of them to drop. If we look at a
single plate (without spinning it), there is a sweet spot on the plate where it balances perfectly on the stick. If we put the
stick anywhere other than that sweet spot, the plate does not balance and it falls to the ground. (That is why performers
spin the plates; the spin helps keep the plates from falling even if the stick is not exactly in the right place.)
Mathematically, that sweet spot is called the center of mass of the plate.
In this section, we first examine these concepts in a one-dimensional context, then expand our development to consider
centers of mass of two-dimensional regions and symmetry. Last, we use centroids to find the volume of certain solids by
applying the theorem of Pappus.
Center of Mass and Moments
Let’s begin by looking at the center of mass in a one-dimensional context. Consider a long, thin wire or rod of negligible
mass resting on a fulcrum, as shown in Figure 2.62(a). Now suppose we place objects having masses
and
at
distances
and
from the fulcrum, respectively, as shown in Figure 2.62(b).

The most common real-life example of a system like this is a playground seesaw, or teeter-totter, with children of
different weights sitting at different distances from the center. On a seesaw, if one child sits at each end, the heavier
child sinks down and the lighter child is lifted into the air. If the heavier child slides in toward the center, though, the
seesaw balances. Applying this concept to the masses on the rod, we note that the masses balance each other if and
only if
In the seesaw example, we balanced the system by moving the masses (children) with respect to the fulcrum. However,
we are really interested in systems in which the masses are not allowed to move, and instead we balance the system by
moving the fulcrum. Suppose we have two point masses,
and
located on a number line at points
and
respectively (Figure 2.63). The center of mass,
is the point where the fulcrum should be placed to make the system
balance.

*Figure 2.63 The center of mass*

is the balance point of the system.
Thus, we have
The expression in the numerator,
is called the first moment of the system with respect to the origin. If the
context is clear, we often drop the word first and just refer to this expression as the moment of the system. The
expression in the denominator,
is the total mass of the system. Thus, the center of mass of the system is the
point at which the total mass of the system could be concentrated without changing the moment.
This idea is not limited just to two point masses. In general, if n masses,
are placed on a number line at
points
respectively, then the center of mass of the system is given by

Center of Mass of Thin Plates
So far we have looked at systems of point masses on a line and in a plane. Now, instead of having the mass of a system
concentrated at discrete points, we want to look at systems in which the mass of the system is distributed continuously
across a thin sheet of material. For our purposes, we assume the sheet is thin enough that it can be treated as if it is twodimensional. Such a sheet is called a lamina. Next we develop techniques to find the center of mass of a lamina. In this
section, we also assume the density of the lamina is constant.
Laminas are often represented by a two-dimensional region in a plane. The geometric center of such a region is called its
centroid. Since we have assumed the density of the lamina is constant, the center of mass of the lamina depends only
on the shape of the corresponding region in the plane; it does not depend on the density. In this case, the center of
mass of the lamina corresponds to the centroid of the delineated region in the plane. As with systems of point masses,
we need to find the total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes.
We first consider a lamina in the shape of a rectangle. Recall that the center of mass of a lamina is the point where the
lamina balances. For a rectangle, that point is both the horizontal and vertical center of the rectangle. Based on this
understanding, it is clear that the center of mass of a rectangular lamina is the point where the diagonals intersect,
which is a result of the symmetry principle, and it is stated here without proof.

#### Theorem 2.11: 

The Symmetry Principle
If a region R is symmetric about a line l, then the centroid of R lies on l.
Let’s turn to more general laminas. Suppose we have a lamina bounded above by the graph of a continuous function
below by the x-axis, and on the left and right by the lines
and
respectively, as shown in the following
figure.

### 2.6 • Moments and Centers of Mass 181




*Figure 2.65 A region in the plane representing a lamina.*

As with systems of point masses, to find the center of mass of the lamina, we need to find the total mass of the lamina,
as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes. As we have done many times before, we
approximate these quantities by partitioning the interval
and constructing rectangles.
For

Next, we need to find the total mass of the rectangle. Let

In this case,

area of the rectangle by
Then, the mass of the rectangle is given by
To get the approximate mass of the lamina, we add the masses of all the rectangles to get
This is a Riemann sum. Taking the limit as
∞gives the exact mass of the lamina:
∞
Next, we calculate the moment of the lamina with respect to the x-axis. Returning to the representative rectangle, recall
its center of mass is
Recall also that treating the rectangle as if it is a point mass located at the center
of mass does not change the moment. Thus, the moment of the rectangle with respect to the x-axis is given by the mass
of the rectangle,
multiplied by the distance from the center of mass to the x-axis:
Therefore, the
moment with respect to the x-axis of the rectangle is
Adding the moments of the rectangles and
taking the limit of the resulting Riemann sum, we see that the moment of the lamina with respect to the x-axis is
∞
We derive the moment with respect to the y-axis similarly, noting that the distance from the center of mass of the

**Solution:**

which leads to the

In the development of the formula for the moment with respect to the x-axis, the moment of each rectangle is found by

STUDENT PROJECT
The Grand Canyon Skywalk
The Grand Canyon Skywalk opened to the public on March 28, 2007. This engineering marvel is a horseshoe-shaped
observation platform suspended 4000 ft above the Colorado River on the West Rim of the Grand Canyon. Its crystalclear glass floor allows stunning views of the canyon below (see the following figure).

*Figure 2.72 The Grand Canyon Skywalk offers magnificent views of the canyon. (credit: 10da_ralta, Wikimedia*

Commons)
The Skywalk is a cantilever design, meaning that the observation platform extends over the rim of the canyon, with
no visible means of support below it. Despite the lack of visible support posts or struts, cantilever structures are
engineered to be very stable and the Skywalk is no exception. The observation platform is attached firmly to support
posts that extend 46 ft down into bedrock. The structure was built to withstand 100-mph winds and an 8.0-magnitude
earthquake within 50 mi, and is capable of supporting more than 70,000,000 lb.
One factor affecting the stability of the Skywalk is the center of gravity of the structure. We are going to calculate the
center of gravity of the Skywalk, and examine how the center of gravity changes when tourists walk out onto the
observation platform.
The observation platform is U-shaped. The legs of the U are 10 ft wide and begin on land, under the visitors’ center,
48 ft from the edge of the canyon. The platform extends 70 ft over the edge of the canyon.
To calculate the center of mass of the structure, we treat it as a lamina and use a two-dimensional region in the
xy-plane to represent the platform. We begin by dividing the region into three subregions so we can consider each
subregion separately. The first region, denoted
consists of the curved part of the U. We model
as a
semicircular annulus, with inner radius 25 ft and outer radius 35 ft, centered at the origin (see the following figure).

Although the Skywalk was built to limit the number of people on the observation platform to 120, the platform is
capable of supporting up to 800 people weighing 200 lb each. If all 800 people were allowed on the platform,
and all of them went to the farthest end of the platform, how would the center of gravity of the system be
affected? (Include the visitor center in the calculations and represent the people by a point mass located at the
farthest edge of the platform, 70 ft from the canyon wall.)
Theorem of Pappus
This section ends with a discussion of the theorem of Pappus for volume, which allows us to find the volume of
particular kinds of solids by using the centroid. (There is also a theorem of Pappus for surface area, but it is much less
useful than the theorem for volume.)

Theorem of Pappus for Volume
Let R be a region in the plane and let l be a line in the plane that does not intersect R. Then the volume of the solid of

We already examined exponential functions and logarithms in earlier chapters. However, we glossed over some key
details in the previous discussions. For example, we did not study how to treat exponential functions with exponents that
are irrational. The definition of the number e is another area where the previous development was somewhat
incomplete. We now have the tools to deal with these concepts in a more mathematically rigorous way, and we do so in
this section.
For purposes of this section, assume we have not yet defined the natural logarithm, the number e, or any of the
integration and differentiation formulas associated with these functions. By the end of the section, we will have studied
these concepts in a mathematically rigorous way (and we will see they are consistent with the concepts we learned
earlier).
We begin the section by defining the natural logarithm in terms of an integral. This definition forms the foundation for
the section. From this definition, we derive differentiation formulas, define the number
and expand these concepts to
logarithms and exponential functions of any base.

### 2.8 Exponential Growth and Decay Learning Objectives

2.8.1 Use the exponential growth model in applications, including population growth and compound
interest.
2.8.2 Explain the concept of doubling time.
2.8.3 Use the exponential decay model in applications, including radioactive decay and Newton’s law of
cooling.
2.8.4 Explain the concept of half-life.
One of the most prevalent applications of exponential functions involves growth and decay models. Exponential growth
and decay show up in a host of natural applications. From population growth and continuously compounded interest to
radioactive decay and Newton’s law of cooling, exponential functions are ubiquitous in nature. In this section, we
examine exponential growth and decay in the context of some of these applications.
Exponential Growth Model
Many systems exhibit exponential growth. These systems follow a model of the form
where
represents the
initial state of the system and
is a positive constant, called the growth constant. Notice that in an exponential growth

### 2.8 • Exponential Growth and Decay 203



model, we have
That is, the rate of growth is proportional to the current function value. This is a key feature of exponential growth.
Equation 2.27 involves derivatives and is called a differential equation. We learn more about differential equations in
Introduction to Differential Equations.
Rule: Exponential Growth Model
Systems that exhibit exponential growth increase according to the mathematical model
where
represents the initial state of the system and
is a constant, called the growth constant.
Population growth is a common example of exponential growth. Consider a population of bacteria, for instance. It seems
plausible that the rate of population growth would be proportional to the size of the population. After all, the more
bacteria there are to reproduce, the faster the population grows. Figure 2.79 and Table 2.1 represent the growth of a
population of bacteria with an initial population of
bacteria and a growth constant of
Notice that after only

Population
Note that we are using a continuous function to model what is inherently discrete behavior. At any given time, the realworld population contains a whole number of bacteria, although the model takes on noninteger values. When using
exponential growth models, we must always be careful to interpret the function values in the context of the
phenomenon we are modeling.

#### Example 2.42: Population Growth

Consider the population of bacteria described earlier. This population grows according to the function
where t is measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after
hours
minutes)? When
does the population reach
bacteria?

**Solution:**

We have
Then
There are
bacteria in the population after
hours.
To find when the population reaches
bacteria, we solve the equation
The population reaches
bacteria after
minutes.
2.42
Consider a population of bacteria that grows according to the function
where
is
measured in minutes. How many bacteria are present in the population after 4 hours? When does the
population reach
million bacteria?
Let’s now turn our attention to a financial application: compound interest. Interest that is not compounded is called
simple interest. Simple interest is paid once, at the end of the specified time period (usually
year). So, if we put
in
a savings account earning
simple interest per year, then at the end of the year we have
Compound interest is paid multiple times per year, depending on the compounding period. Therefore, if the bank
compounds the interest every
months, it credits half of the year’s interest to the account after
months. During the
second half of the year, the account earns interest not only on the initial
but also on the interest earned during
the first half of the year. Mathematically speaking, at the end of the year, we have

### 2.8 • Exponential Growth and Decay 205



Similarly, if the interest is compounded every
months, we have
and if the interest is compounded daily
times per year), we have
If we extend this concept, so that the
interest is compounded continuously, after
years we have
∞
Now let’s manipulate this expression so that we have an exponential growth function. Recall that the number
can be
expressed as a limit:
∞
Based on this, we want the expression inside the parentheses to have the form
Let
Note that as

We recognize the limit inside the brackets as the number
So, the balance in our bank account after
years is given by
Generalizing this concept, we see that if a bank account with an initial balance of
earns interest at a rate
of
compounded continuously, then the balance of the account after
years is

If, instead, she is able to earn
then the equation becomes
In this case, she needs to invest only
This is roughly two-thirds the amount she needs to invest at

fact that the interest is compounded continuously greatly magnifies the effect of the
increase in interest rate.

Suppose instead of investing at age

If a quantity grows exponentially, the time it takes for the quantity to double remains constant. In other words, it takes
the same amount of time for a population of bacteria to grow from
to
bacteria as it does to grow from
to

bacteria. This time is called the doubling time. To calculate the doubling time, we want to know when the quantity
reaches twice its original size. So we have
Definition
If a quantity grows exponentially, the doubling time is the amount of time it takes the quantity to double. It is given
by

#### Example 2.44: Using the Doubling Time

Assume a population of fish grows exponentially. A pond is stocked initially with
fish. After
months, there are
fish in the pond. The owner will allow his friends and neighbors to fish on his pond after the fish population reaches
When will the owner’s friends be allowed to fish?

**Solution:**

We know it takes the population of fish
months to double in size. So, if t represents time in months, by the doublingtime formula, we have
Then,
Thus, the population is given by
To figure out
when the population reaches
fish, we must solve the following equation:
The owner’s friends have to wait
months (a little more than
years) to fish in the pond.
2.44
Suppose it takes
months for the fish population in Example 2.44 to reach
fish. Under these
circumstances, how long do the owner’s friends have to wait?
Exponential Decay Model
Exponential functions can also be used to model populations that shrink (from disease, for example), or chemical
compounds that break down over time. We say that such systems exhibit exponential decay, rather than exponential
growth. The model is nearly the same, except there is a negative sign in the exponent. Thus, for some positive constant
we have
As with exponential growth, there is a differential equation associated with exponential decay. We have
Rule: Exponential Decay Model
Systems that exhibit exponential decay behave according to the model

represents the initial state of the system and
is a constant, called the decay constant.

### 2.8 • Exponential Growth and Decay 207



The following figure shows a graph of a representative exponential decay function.

*Figure 2.80 An example of exponential decay.*

Let’s look at a physical application of exponential decay. Newton’s law of cooling says that an object cools at a rate
proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the surroundings. In other
words, if
represents the temperature of the object and
represents the ambient temperature in a room, then
Note that this is not quite the right model for exponential decay. We want the derivative to be proportional to the
function, and this expression has the additional
term. Fortunately, we can make a change of variables that resolves
this issue. Let
Then
and our equation becomes
From our previous work, we know this relationship between y and its derivative leads to exponential decay. Thus,
and we see that
where

Just as systems exhibiting exponential growth have a constant doubling time, systems exhibiting exponential decay have
a constant half-life. To calculate the half-life, we want to know when the quantity reaches half its original size. Therefore,
we have
Note: This is the same expression we came up with for doubling time.
Definition
If a quantity decays exponentially, the half-life is the amount of time it takes the quantity to be reduced by half. It is
given by

One physical application of hyperbolic functions involves hanging cables. If a cable of uniform density is suspended
between two supports without any load other than its own weight, the cable forms a curve called a catenary. Highvoltage power lines, chains hanging between two posts, and strands of a spider’s web all form catenaries. The following

#### Key Concepts


### 2.1 Areas between Curves •

Just as definite integrals can be used to find the area under a curve, they can also be used to find the area between
two curves.
•
To find the area between two curves defined by functions, integrate the difference of the functions.
•
If the graphs of the functions cross, or if the region is complex, use the absolute value of the difference of the
functions. In this case, it may be necessary to evaluate two or more integrals and add the results to find the area of
the region.
•
Sometimes it can be easier to integrate with respect to y to find the area. The principles are the same regardless of
which variable is used as the variable of integration.

### 2.2 Determining Volumes by Slicing •

Definite integrals can be used to find the volumes of solids. Using the slicing method, we can find a volume by
integrating the cross-sectional area.
•
For solids of revolution, the volume slices are often disks and the cross-sections are circles. The method of disks
involves applying the method of slicing in the particular case in which the cross-sections are circles, and using the
formula for the area of a circle.
•
If a solid of revolution has a cavity in the center, the volume slices are washers. With the method of washers, the
area of the inner circle is subtracted from the area of the outer circle before integrating.

### 2.3 Volumes of Revolution: Cylindrical Shells •

The method of cylindrical shells is another method for using a definite integral to calculate the volume of a solid of
revolution. This method is sometimes preferable to either the method of disks or the method of washers because
we integrate with respect to the other variable. In some cases, one integral is substantially more complicated than
the other.
•
The geometry of the functions and the difficulty of the integration are the main factors in deciding which integration
method to use.

### 2.4 Arc Length of a Curve and Surface Area •

The arc length of a curve can be calculated using a definite integral.
•
The arc length is first approximated using line segments, which generates a Riemann sum. Taking a limit then gives
us the definite integral formula. The same process can be applied to functions of
•
The concepts used to calculate the arc length can be generalized to find the surface area of a surface of revolution.
•
The integrals generated by both the arc length and surface area formulas are often difficult to evaluate. It may be
necessary to use a computer or calculator to approximate the values of the integrals.

### 2.5 Physical Applications •

Several physical applications of the definite integral are common in engineering and physics.
•
Definite integrals can be used to determine the mass of an object if its density function is known.
•
Work can also be calculated from integrating a force function, or when counteracting the force of gravity, as in a
pumping problem.
•
Definite integrals can also be used to calculate the force exerted on an object submerged in a liquid.

### 2.6 Moments and Centers of Mass •

Mathematically, the center of mass of a system is the point at which the total mass of the system could be
concentrated without changing the moment. Loosely speaking, the center of mass can be thought of as the
balancing point of the system.
•
For point masses distributed along a number line, the moment of the system with respect to the origin is
For point masses distributed in a plane, the moments of the system with respect to the x- and

y-axes, respectively, are
and
respectively.
•
For a lamina bounded above by a function
the moments of the system with respect to the x- and y-axes,
respectively, are
and
•
The x- and y-coordinates of the center of mass can be found by dividing the moments around the y-axis and around
the x-axis, respectively, by the total mass. The symmetry principle says that if a region is symmetric with respect to a
line, then the centroid of the region lies on the line.
•
The theorem of Pappus for volume says that if a region is revolved around an external axis, the volume of the
resulting solid is equal to the area of the region multiplied by the distance traveled by the centroid of the region.

### 2.7 Integrals, Exponential Functions, and Logarithms •

The earlier treatment of logarithms and exponential functions did not define the functions precisely and formally.
This section develops the concepts in a mathematically rigorous way.
•
The cornerstone of the development is the definition of the natural logarithm in terms of an integral.
•
The function
is then defined as the inverse of the natural logarithm.
•
General exponential functions are defined in terms of
and the corresponding inverse functions are general
logarithms.
•
Familiar properties of logarithms and exponents still hold in this more rigorous context.

### 2.8 Exponential Growth and Decay •

Exponential growth and exponential decay are two of the most common applications of exponential functions.
•
Systems that exhibit exponential growth follow a model of the form
•
In exponential growth, the rate of growth is proportional to the quantity present. In other words,
•
Systems that exhibit exponential growth have a constant doubling time, which is given by
•
Systems that exhibit exponential decay follow a model of the form
•
Systems that exhibit exponential decay have a constant half-life, which is given by

### 2.9 Calculus of the Hyperbolic Functions •

Hyperbolic functions are defined in terms of exponential functions.
•
Term-by-term differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the hyperbolic functions. These differentiation
formulas give rise, in turn, to integration formulas.
•
With appropriate range restrictions, the hyperbolic functions all have inverses.
•
Implicit differentiation yields differentiation formulas for the inverse hyperbolic functions, which in turn give rise to
integration formulas.
•
The most common physical applications of hyperbolic functions are calculations involving catenaries.

### 3.7 Improper Integrals Introduction

In a large city, accidents occurred at an average rate of one every three months at a particularly busy intersection. After
residents complained, changes were made to the traffic lights at the intersection. It has now been eight months since
the changes were made and there have been no accidents. Were the changes effective or is the eight-month interval
without an accident a result of chance? We explore this question later in this chapter and see that integration is an
essential part of determining the answer (see Example 3.49).
We saw in the previous chapter how important integration can be for all kinds of different topics—from calculations of
volumes to flow rates, and from using a velocity function to determine a position to locating centers of mass. It is no
surprise, then, that techniques for finding antiderivatives (or indefinite integrals) are important to know for everyone
who uses them. We have already discussed some basic integration formulas and the method of integration by
substitution. In this chapter, we study some additional techniques, including some ways of approximating definite
integrals when normal techniques do not work.

integrate

something as simple looking as

students want to know whether there is a product rule for integration. There isn’t, but there is a technique based on the
product rule for differentiation that allows us to exchange one integral for another. We call this technique integration by
parts.

Thus, we put LI at the beginning of the mnemonic. (We could just as easily have started with IL,

the method of strategic substitution, then it is a good idea to check the result by recombining the terms algebraically.

The General Method
Now that we are beginning to get the idea of how the technique of partial fraction decomposition works, let’s outline the
basic method in the following problem-solving strategy.

that has no real zeros.

In addition to the techniques of integration we have already seen, several other tools are widely available to assist with

calculators and in many campus computer labs, and are free online.
Tables of Integrals
Integration tables, if used in the right manner, can be a handy way either to evaluate or check an integral quickly. Keep in
mind that when using a table to check an answer, it is possible for two completely correct solutions to look very different.
For example, in Trigonometric Substitution, we found that, by using the substitution

The antiderivatives of many functions either cannot be expressed or cannot be expressed easily in closed form (that is, in
terms of known functions). Consequently, rather than evaluate definite integrals of these functions directly, we resort to
various techniques of numerical integration to approximate their values. In this section we explore several of these
techniques. In addition, we examine the process of estimating the error in using these techniques.
The Midpoint Rule
Earlier in this text we defined the definite integral of a function over an interval as the limit of Riemann sums. In general,
any Riemann sum of a function
over an interval
may be viewed as an estimate of

The midpoint rule for estimating a definite integral uses a Riemann sum with subintervals of equal width and the
midpoints,

midpoint rule as follows.

The Trapezoidal Rule
We can also approximate the value of a definite integral by using trapezoids rather than rectangles. In Figure 3.14, the
area beneath the curve is approximated by trapezoids rather than by rectangles.

*Figure 3.14 Trapezoids may be used to approximate the area under a curve, hence approximating the definite integral.*

The trapezoidal rule for estimating definite integrals uses trapezoids rather than rectangles to approximate the area
under a curve. To gain insight into the final form of the rule, consider the trapezoids shown in Figure 3.14. We assume
that the length of each subinterval is given by
First, recall that the area of a trapezoid with a height of h and bases of
length

approximate the integral using the left-hand and right-hand endpoints of each subinterval,
respectively. In addition, a careful examination of Figure 3.15 leads us to make the following observations about using
the trapezoidal rules and midpoint rules to estimate the definite integral of a nonnegative function. The trapezoidal rule
tends to overestimate the value of a definite integral systematically over intervals where the function is concave up and
to underestimate the value of a definite integral systematically over intervals where the function is concave down. On the
other hand, the midpoint rule tends to average out these errors somewhat by partially overestimating and partially
underestimating the value of the definite integral over these same types of intervals. This leads us to hypothesize that, in
general, the midpoint rule tends to be more accurate than the trapezoidal rule.

*Figure 3.15 The trapezoidal rule tends to be less accurate than the midpoint rule.*

Absolute and Relative Error
An important aspect of using these numerical approximation rules consists of calculating the error in using them for
estimating the value of a definite integral. We first need to define absolute error and relative error.
Definition

is our estimate of some quantity having an actual value of
then the absolute error is given by
The
relative error is the error as a percentage of the absolute value and is given by

In the two previous examples, we were able to compare our estimate of an integral with the actual value of the integral;
however, we do not typically have this luxury. In general, if we are approximating an integral, we are doing so because
we cannot compute the exact value of the integral itself easily. Therefore, it is often helpful to be able to determine an
upper bound for the error in an approximation of an integral. The following theorem provides error bounds for the
midpoint and trapezoidal rules. The theorem is stated without proof.

#### Theorem 3.5:

We need to keep in mind that the error estimates provide an upper bound only
for the error. The actual estimate may, in fact, be a much better approximation than is indicated by the error bound.
3.25
Use Equation 3.13 to find an upper bound for the error in using

Simpson’s Rule
With the midpoint rule, we estimated areas of regions under curves by using rectangles. In a sense, we approximated
the curve with piecewise constant functions. With the trapezoidal rule, we approximated the curve by using piecewise
linear functions. What if we were, instead, to approximate a curve using piecewise quadratic functions? With Simpson’s
rule, we do just this. We partition the interval into an even number of subintervals, each of equal width. Over the first
pair of subintervals we approximate
with
where
is the quadratic
function passing through
and
(Figure 3.16). Over the next pair of subintervals we
approximate
with the integral of another quadratic function passing through
and
This process is continued with each successive pair of subintervals.

*Figure 3.16 With Simpson’s rule, we approximate a definite integral by integrating a piecewise quadratic function.*

To understand the formula that we obtain for Simpson’s rule, we begin by deriving a formula for this approximation over
the first two subintervals. As we go through the derivation, we need to keep in mind the following relationships:
where

If we approximate
using the same method, we see that we have
Combining these two approximations, we get
The pattern continues as we add pairs of subintervals to our approximation. The general rule may be stated as follows.

Just as the trapezoidal rule is the average of the left-hand and right-hand rules for estimating definite integrals,
Simpson’s rule may be obtained from the midpoint and trapezoidal rules by using a weighted average. It can be shown
that
It is also possible to put a bound on the error when using Simpson’s rule to approximate a definite integral. The bound in
the error is given by the following rule:

In this section, we define integrals over an infinite interval as well as integrals of functions containing a discontinuity on
the interval. Integrals of these types are called improper integrals. We examine several techniques for evaluating
improper integrals, all of which involve taking limits.

limit, taken as one of the limits of integration increases or decreases without bound.

finite or infinite?

#### Example 3.47: Finding an Area

Determine whether the area between the graph of

is finite or infinite.

**Solution:**

We first do a quick sketch of the region in question, as shown in the following graph.

#### Example 3.49: Chapter Opener: Traffic Accidents in a City


*Figure 3.20 (credit: modification of work by David McKelvey, Flickr)*

In the chapter opener, we stated the following problem: Suppose that at a busy intersection, traffic accidents occur at an
average rate of one every three months. After residents complained, changes were made to the traffic lights at the
intersection. It has now been eight months since the changes were made and there have been no accidents. Were the
changes effective or is the 8-month interval without an accident a result of chance?
Probability theory tells us that if the average time between events is
the probability that
the time between events,
is between
and
is given by
Thus, if accidents are occurring at a rate of one every 3 months, then the probability that
the time between accidents,
is between
and
is given by
To answer the question, we must compute
∞
and decide whether it is likely that 8 months
could have passed without an accident if there had been no improvement in the traffic situation.

**Solution:**

We need to calculate the probability as an improper integral:

∞
∞

The value
represents the probability of no accidents in 8 months under the initial conditions. Since this
value is very, very small, it is reasonable to conclude the changes were effective.

next project, we are going to explore a more advanced application of integration: integral transforms. Specifically, we
describe the Laplace transform and some of its properties. The Laplace transform is used in engineering and physics
to simplify the computations needed to solve some problems. It takes functions expressed in terms of time and
transforms them to functions expressed in terms of frequency. It turns out that, in many cases, the computations
needed to solve problems in the frequency domain are much simpler than those required in the time domain.

### 3.1 Integration by Parts •

The integration-by-parts formula allows the exchange of one integral for another, possibly easier, integral.
•
Integration by parts applies to both definite and indefinite integrals.

### 3.2 Trigonometric Integrals •

Integrals of trigonometric functions can be evaluated by the use of various strategies. These strategies include
1.
Applying trigonometric identities to rewrite the integral so that it may be evaluated by u-substitution
2.

functions that can be integrated using previously learned techniques.
•
When applying partial fraction decomposition, we must make sure that the degree of the numerator is less than the
degree of the denominator. If not, we need to perform long division before attempting partial fraction
decomposition.
•
The form the decomposition takes depends on the type of factors in the denominator. The types of factors include
nonrepeated linear factors, repeated linear factors, nonrepeated irreducible quadratic factors, and repeated
irreducible quadratic factors.

### 3.5 Other Strategies for Integration •

An integration table may be used to evaluate indefinite integrals.
•
A CAS (or computer algebra system) may be used to evaluate indefinite integrals.
•
It may require some effort to reconcile equivalent solutions obtained using different methods.

### 3.6 Numerical Integration •

We can use numerical integration to estimate the values of definite integrals when a closed form of the integral is
difficult to find or when an approximate value only of the definite integral is needed.
•
The most commonly used techniques for numerical integration are the midpoint rule, trapezoidal rule, and
Simpson’s rule.
•
The midpoint rule approximates the definite integral using rectangular regions whereas the trapezoidal rule
approximates the definite integral using trapezoidal approximations.
•
Simpson’s rule approximates the definite integral by first approximating the original function using piecewise
quadratic functions.

### 3.7 Improper Integrals •

Integrals of functions over infinite intervals are defined in terms of limits.
•
Integrals of functions over an interval for which the function has a discontinuity at an endpoint may be defined in
terms of limits.
•
The convergence or divergence of an improper integral may be determined by comparing it with the value of an
improper integral for which the convergence or divergence is known.

assumptions to derive a mathematical model for different scenarios. Some factors that are often considered are
environmental impact, threshold population values, and predators. In this chapter we see how differential equations can
be used to predict populations over time (see Example 4.14).
Another goal of this chapter is to develop solution techniques for different types of differential equations. As the
equations become more complicated, the solution techniques also become more complicated, and in fact an entire
course could be dedicated to the study of these equations. In this chapter we study several types of differential
equations and their corresponding methods of solution.

Calculus is the mathematics of change, and rates of change are expressed by derivatives. Thus, one of the most common
ways to use calculus is to set up an equation containing an unknown function
and its derivative, known as a
differential equation. Solving such equations often provides information about how quantities change and frequently
provides insight into how and why the changes occur.
Techniques for solving differential equations can take many different forms, including direct solution, use of graphs, or
computer calculations. We introduce the main ideas in this chapter and describe them in a little more detail later in the
course. In this section we study what differential equations are, how to verify their solutions, some methods that are
used for solving them, and some examples of common and useful equations.
General Differential Equations
Consider the equation
which is an example of a differential equation because it includes a derivative. There is
a relationship between the variables
and
is an unknown function of
Furthermore, the left-hand side of the
equation is the derivative of
Therefore we can interpret this equation as follows: Start with some function
and take its derivative. The answer must be equal to
What function has a derivative that is equal to
One such
function is
so this function is considered a solution to a differential equation.
Definition
A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function
and one or more of its derivatives. A
solution to a differential equation is a function
that satisfies the differential equation when
and its
derivatives are substituted into the equation.

**Solution:**

To verify the solution, we first calculate
using the chain rule for derivatives. This gives
Next we

and
into the left-hand side of the differential equation:
The resulting expression can be simplified by first distributing to eliminate the parentheses, giving
Combining like terms leads to the expression
which is equal to the right-hand side of the differential equation.
This result verifies that

Verify that
is a solution to the differential equation
It is convenient to define characteristics of differential equations that make it easier to talk about them and categorize
them. The most basic characteristic of a differential equation is its order.
Definition
The order of a differential equation is the highest order of any derivative of the unknown function that appears in
the equation.

General and Particular Solutions
We already noted that the differential equation
has at least two solutions:
and
The only
difference between these two solutions is the last term, which is a constant. What if the last term is a different constant?
Will this expression still be a solution to the differential equation? In fact, any function of the form
where
represents any constant, is a solution as well. The reason is that the derivative of

regardless of the value of
It can be shown that any solution of this differential equation must be of the form

In this example, we are free to choose any solution we wish; for example,

solutions to this differential equation. This is called a particular solution to the differential equation. A particular
solution can often be uniquely identified if we are given additional information about the problem.

Initial-Value Problems
Usually a given differential equation has an infinite number of solutions, so it is natural to ask which one we want to use.
To choose one solution, more information is needed. Some specific information that can be useful is an initial value,
which is an ordered pair that is used to find a particular solution.
A differential equation together with one or more initial values is called an initial-value problem. The general rule is
that the number of initial values needed for an initial-value problem is equal to the order of the differential equation. For
example, if we have the differential equation
then
is an initial value, and when taken together, these
equations form an initial-value problem. The differential equation
is second order, so we need two
initial values. With initial-value problems of order greater than one, the same value should be used for the independent
variable. An example of initial values for this second-order equation would be
and
These two initial
values together with the differential equation form an initial-value problem. These problems are so named because
often the independent variable in the unknown function is
which represents time. Thus, a value of

beginning of the problem.

#### Example 4.4: Verifying a Solution to an Initial-Value Problem

Verify that the function
is a solution to the initial-value problem

**Solution:**

For a function to satisfy an initial-value problem, it must satisfy both the differential equation and the initial condition. To
show that
satisfies the differential equation, we start by calculating
This gives
Next we substitute
both
and
into the left-hand side of the differential equation and simplify:
This is equal to the right-hand side of the differential equation, so
solves the differential equation. Next
we calculate
This result verifies the initial value. Therefore the given function satisfies the initial-value problem.
4.4
Verify that
is a solution to the initial-value problem
In Example 4.4, the initial-value problem consisted of two parts. The first part was the differential equation
and the second part was the initial value
These two equations together formed the initial-value
problem.
The same is true in general. An initial-value problem consists of two parts: the differential equation and the initial
condition. The differential equation has a family of solutions, and the initial condition determines the value of
The
family of solutions to the differential equation in Example 4.4 is given by

#### Example 4.5: Solving an Initial-value Problem

Solve the following initial-value problem:

**Solution:**

The first step in solving this initial-value problem is to find a general family of solutions. To do this, we find an
antiderivative of both sides of the differential equation
namely,
We are able to integrate both sides because the y term appears by itself. Notice that there are two integration constants:
and
Solving Equation 4.1 for
gives
Because
and
are both constants,
is also a constant. We can therefore define
which leads
to the equation
Next we determine the value of
To do this, we substitute
and
into Equation 4.1 and solve for
Now we substitute the value
into Equation 4.1. The solution to the initial-value problem is
Analysis
The difference between a general solution and a particular solution is that a general solution involves a family of
functions, either explicitly or implicitly defined, of the independent variable. The initial value or values determine which
particular solution in the family of solutions satisfies the desired conditions.
4.5
Solve the initial-value problem
In physics and engineering applications, we often consider the forces acting upon an object, and use this information to
understand the resulting motion that may occur. For example, if we start with an object at Earth’s surface, the primary
force acting upon that object is gravity. Physicists and engineers can use this information, along with Newton’s second
law of motion (in equation form
where
represents force,
represents mass, and
represents acceleration),
to derive an equation that can be solved.

*Figure 4.4 For a baseball falling in air, the only force acting on it is gravity (neglecting air resistance).*

In Figure 4.4 we assume that the only force acting on a baseball is the force of gravity. This assumption ignores air
resistance. (The force due to air resistance is considered in a later discussion.) The acceleration due to gravity at Earth’s
surface,
is approximately
We introduce a frame of reference, where Earth’s surface is at a height of 0 meters.
Let
represent the velocity of the object in meters per second. If
the ball is rising, and if
the ball is
falling (Figure 4.5).

*Figure 4.5 Possible velocities for the rising/falling baseball.*

Our goal is to solve for the velocity
at any time
To do this, we set up an initial-value problem. Suppose the mass of
the ball is
where
is measured in kilograms. We use Newton’s second law, which states that the force acting on an
object is equal to its mass times its acceleration
Acceleration is the derivative of velocity, so
Therefore the force acting on the baseball is given by
However, this force must be equal to the force of
gravity acting on the object, which (again using Newton’s second law) is given by
since this force acts in a
downward direction. Therefore we obtain the equation
which becomes
Dividing both sides of
the equation by
gives the equation
Notice that this differential equation remains the same regardless of the mass of the object.
We now need an initial value. Because we are solving for velocity, it makes sense in the context of the problem to assume
that we know the initial velocity, or the velocity at time
This is denoted by

Therefore the initial-value problem is
The first step in solving this initial-value problem is to take the antiderivative of both sides of the differential

The next step is to solve for
To do this, substitute

The units of velocity are meters per second. Since the answer is negative, the object is falling at a speed of
4.6
Suppose a rock falls from rest from a height of
meters and the only force acting on it is gravity. Find an
equation for the velocity
as a function of time, measured in meters per second.
A natural question to ask after solving this type of problem is how high the object will be above Earth’s surface at a given
point in time. Let
denote the height above Earth’s surface of the object, measured in meters. Because velocity is the
derivative of position (in this case height), this assumption gives the equation
An initial value is necessary;
in this case the initial height of the object works well. Let the initial height be given by the equation
Together
these assumptions give the initial-value problem
If the velocity function is known, then it is possible to solve for the position function as well.

4.2.3 Use Euler’s Method to approximate the solution to a first-order differential equation.
For the rest of this chapter we will focus on various methods for solving differential equations and analyzing the
behavior of the solutions. In some cases it is possible to predict properties of a solution to a differential equation without
knowing the actual solution. We will also study numerical methods for solving differential equations, which can be
programmed by using various computer languages or even by using a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel.
Creating Direction Fields
Direction fields (also called slope fields) are useful for investigating first-order differential equations. In particular, we
consider a first-order differential equation of the form
An applied example of this type of differential equation appears in Newton’s law of cooling, which we will solve explicitly

The idea behind a direction field is the fact that the derivative of a function evaluated at a given point is the slope of the
tangent line to the graph of that function at the same point. Other examples of differential equations for which we can

To create a direction field, we start with the first equation:
We let

substitute these numbers into the right-hand side of the differential equation. For example, if we choose
substituting into the right-hand side of the differential equation yields
This tells us that if a solution to the differential equation

Therefore any point in the Cartesian plane has a slope associated with it, assuming that a
solution to the differential equation passes through that point. The direction field for the differential equation

We can generate a direction field of this type for any differential equation of the form
Definition
A direction field (slope field) is a mathematical object used to graphically represent solutions to a first-order
differential equation. At each point in a direction field, a line segment appears whose slope is equal to the slope of a
solution to the differential equation passing through that point.
Using Direction Fields
We can use a direction field to predict the behavior of solutions to a differential equation without knowing the actual
solution. For example, the direction field in Figure 4.7 serves as a guide to the behavior of solutions to the differential
equation
To use a direction field, we start by choosing any point in the field. The line segment at that point serves as a signpost
telling us what direction to go from there. For example, if a solution to the differential equation passes through the point
then the slope of the solution passing through that point is given by
Now let

At this point the slope of the solution changes (again according to the differential equation). We can keep progressing,
recalculating the slope of the solution as we take small steps to the right, and watching the behavior of the solution.

### 4.3 Separable Equations Learning Objectives

4.3.1 Use separation of variables to solve a differential equation.
4.3.2 Solve applications using separation of variables.
We now examine a solution technique for finding exact solutions to a class of differential equations known as separable
differential equations. These equations are common in a wide variety of disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and
engineering. We illustrate a few applications at the end of the section.
Separation of Variables
We start with a definition and some examples.
Definition
A separable differential equation is any equation that can be written in the form
The term ‘separable’ refers to the fact that the right-hand side of the equation can be separated into a function of
times a function of
Examples of separable differential equations include
The second equation is separable with
and
the third equation is separable with
and
and the right-hand side of the fourth equation can be factored as
so it is separable
as well. The third equation is also called an autonomous differential equation because the right-hand side of the
equation is a function of
alone. If a differential equation is separable, then it is possible to solve the equation using the
method of separation of variables.
Problem-Solving Strategy

To solve this equation for
first multiply both sides of the equation by

an arbitrary constant. If we call the second arbitrary constant
the equation becomes
Now exponentiate both sides of the equation (i.e., make each side of the equation the exponent for the base
Again define a new constant

This corresponds to two separate equations:
and
The solution to either equation can be written in the form
Since
it does not matter whether we use plus or minus, so the constant can actually have either sign.
Furthermore, the subscript on the constant
is entirely arbitrary, and can be dropped. Therefore the solution can
be written as

No initial condition is imposed, so we are finished.

Find the solution to the initial-value problem
using the method of separation of variables.
Applications of Separation of Variables
Many interesting problems can be described by separable equations. We illustrate two types of problems: solution
concentrations and Newton’s law of cooling.
Solution concentrations
Consider a tank being filled with a salt solution. We would like to determine the amount of salt present in the tank as a
function of time. We can apply the process of separation of variables to solve this problem and similar problems
involving solution concentrations.

#### Example 4.12: Determining Salt Concentration over Time

A tank containing
of a brine solution initially has
of salt dissolved in the solution. At time
another brine
solution flows into the tank at a rate of
This brine solution contains a concentration of
of salt. At the
same time, a stopcock is opened at the bottom of the tank, allowing the combined solution to flow out at a rate of
so that the level of liquid in the tank remains constant (Figure 4.16). Find the amount of salt in the tank as a
function of time (measured in minutes), and find the limiting amount of salt in the tank, assuming that the solution in
the tank is well mixed at all times.

### 4.3 • Separable Equations 337




*Figure 4.16 A brine tank with an initial amount of salt solution accepts an input flow and delivers an output flow. How*

does the amount of salt change with time?

**Solution:**

First we define a function
that represents the amount of salt in kilograms in the tank as a function of time. Then
represents the rate at which the amount of salt in the tank changes as a function of time. Also,
represents the
amount of salt in the tank at time
which is
kilograms.
The general setup for the differential equation we will solve is of the form
INFLOW RATE represents the rate at which salt enters the tank, and OUTFLOW RATE represents the rate at which salt
leaves the tank. Because solution enters the tank at a rate of
L/min, and each liter of solution contains
kilogram of
salt, every minute
of salt enters the tank. Therefore INFLOW RATE =
To calculate the rate at which salt leaves the tank, we need the concentration of salt in the tank at any point in time.
Since the actual amount of salt varies over time, so does the concentration of salt. However, the volume of the solution
remains fixed at 100 liters. The number of kilograms of salt in the tank at time
is equal to
Thus, the concentration
of salt is
kg/L, and the solution leaves the tank at a rate of
L/min. Therefore salt leaves the tank at a rate of
kg/min, and OUTFLOW RATE is equal to
Therefore the differential equation becomes
and the initial condition is
The initial-value problem to be solved is
The differential equation is a separable equation, so we can apply the five-step strategy for solution.
Step 1. Setting
gives
as a constant solution. Since the initial amount of salt in the tank is
kilograms,
this solution does not apply.
Step 2. Rewrite the equation as
Then multiply both sides by
and divide both sides by

Eliminate the absolute value by allowing the constant to be either positive or negative:
Finally, solve for
Step 5. Solve for
The solution to the initial value problem is
To find the limiting amount of salt in the tank, take the
limit as
approaches infinity:
∞
Note that this was the constant solution to the differential equation. If the initial amount of salt in the tank is
kilograms, then it remains constant. If it starts at less than 50 kilograms, then it approaches 50 kilograms over time.

A tank contains
kilograms of salt dissolved in
liters of water. A salt solution of
is pumped
into the tank at a rate of
and is drained at the same rate. Solve for the salt concentration at time
Assume the tank is well mixed at all times.
Newton’s law of cooling
Newton’s law of cooling states that the rate of change of an object’s temperature is proportional to the difference
between its own temperature and the ambient temperature (i.e., the temperature of its surroundings). If we let
represent the temperature of an object as a function of time, then
represents the rate at which that temperature
changes. The temperature of the object’s surroundings can be represented by
Then Newton’s law of cooling can be
written in the form
or simply
The temperature of the object at the beginning of any experiment is the initial value for the initial-value problem. We call
this temperature
Therefore the initial-value problem that needs to be solved takes the form
where
is a constant that needs to be either given or determined in the context of the problem. We use these equations
in Example 4.13.

**Solution:**

Therefore Equation 4.4 becomes

### 4.4 The Logistic Equation Learning Objectives

4.4.1 Describe the concept of environmental carrying capacity in the logistic model of population growth.
4.4.2 Draw a direction field for a logistic equation and interpret the solution curves.
4.4.3 Solve a logistic equation and interpret the results.
Differential equations can be used to represent the size of a population as it varies over time. We saw this in an earlier
chapter in the section on exponential growth and decay, which is the simplest model. A more realistic model includes
other factors that affect the growth of the population. In this section, we study the logistic differential equation and see
how it applies to the study of population dynamics in the context of biology.
Population Growth and Carrying Capacity
To model population growth using a differential equation, we first need to introduce some variables and relevant terms.
The variable
will represent time. The units of time can be hours, days, weeks, months, or even years. Any given
problem must specify the units used in that particular problem. The variable
will represent population. Since the
population varies over time, it is understood to be a function of time. Therefore we use the notation
for the
population as a function of time. If
is a differentiable function, then the first derivative
represents the
instantaneous rate of change of the population as a function of time.
In Exponential Growth and Decay, we studied the exponential growth and decay of populations and radioactive
substances. An example of an exponential growth function is
In this function,
represents the
population at time
represents the initial population (population at time
and the constant
is called the
growth rate. Figure 4.18 shows a graph of
Here
and

*Figure 4.18 An exponential growth model of population.*

We can verify that the function
satisfies the initial-value problem
This differential equation has an interesting interpretation. The left-hand side represents the rate at which the
population increases (or decreases). The right-hand side is equal to a positive constant multiplied by the current
population. Therefore the differential equation states that the rate at which the population increases is proportional to
the population at that point in time. Furthermore, it states that the constant of proportionality never changes.

One problem with this function is its prediction that as time goes on, the population grows without bound. This is
unrealistic in a real-world setting. Various factors limit the rate of growth of a particular population, including birth rate,
death rate, food supply, predators, and so on. The growth constant
usually takes into consideration the birth and death
rates but none of the other factors, and it can be interpreted as a net (birth minus death) percent growth rate per unit
time. A natural question to ask is whether the population growth rate stays constant, or whether it changes over time.
Biologists have found that in many biological systems, the population grows until a certain steady-state population is
reached. This possibility is not taken into account with exponential growth. However, the concept of carrying capacity
allows for the possibility that in a given area, only a certain number of a given organism or animal can thrive without
running into resource issues.
Definition
The carrying capacity of an organism in a given environment is defined to be the maximum population of that
organism that the environment can sustain indefinitely.
We use the variable
to denote the carrying capacity. The growth rate is represented by the variable
Using these
variables, we can define the logistic differential equation.
Definition
Let
represent the carrying capacity for a particular organism in a given environment, and let
be a real number
that represents the growth rate. The function
represents the population of this organism as a function of time
and the constant
represents the initial population (population of the organism at time
Then the logistic
differential equation is
MEDIA
See this website (http://www.openstax.org/l/20_logisticEq) for more information on the logistic equation.
The logistic equation was first published by Pierre Verhulst in
This differential equation can be coupled with the
initial condition
to form an initial-value problem for
Suppose that the initial population is small relative to the carrying capacity. Then
is small, possibly close to zero. Thus,
the quantity in parentheses on the right-hand side of Equation 4.8 is close to
and the right-hand side of this equation
is close to
If
then the population grows rapidly, resembling exponential growth.
However, as the population grows, the ratio
also grows, because
is constant. If the population remains below the
carrying capacity, then
is less than
so
Therefore the right-hand side of Equation 4.8 is still positive, but
the quantity in parentheses gets smaller, and the growth rate decreases as a result. If
then the right-hand side is
equal to zero, and the population does not change.
Now suppose that the population starts at a value higher than the carrying capacity. Then
and
Then
the right-hand side of Equation 4.8 is negative, and the population decreases. As long as
the population
decreases. It never actually reaches
because
will get smaller and smaller, but the population approaches the

#### Example 4.14: Chapter Opener: Examining the Carrying Capacity of a Deer Population


*Figure 4.20 (credit: modification of work by Rachel Kramer, Flickr)*

Let’s consider the population of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in the state of Kentucky. The Kentucky
Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources (KDFWR) sets guidelines for hunting and fishing in the state. Before the
hunting season of
it estimated a population of
deer. Johnson notes: “A deer population that has plenty to
eat and is not hunted by humans or other predators will double every three years.” (George Johnson, “The Problem of
Exploding Deer Populations Has No Attractive Solutions,” January
accessed April 9, 2015,
http://www.txtwriter.com/onscience/Articles/deerpops.html.) This observation corresponds to a rate of increase
so the approximate growth rate is
per year. (This assumes that the population grows
exponentially, which is reasonable––at least in the short term––with plentiful food supply and no predators.) The KDFWR
also reports deer population densities for
counties in Kentucky, the average of which is approximately
deer per
square mile. Suppose this is the deer density for the whole state
square miles). The carrying capacity
is
square miles times
deer per square mile, or

growth rate of
Working under the assumption that the population grows according to the logistic differential equation, this graph
predicts that approximately
years earlier
the growth of the population was very close to exponential. The net
growth rate at that time would have been around
per year. As time goes on, the two graphs separate. This
happens because the population increases, and the logistic differential equation states that the growth rate decreases as
the population increases. At the time the population was measured
it was close to carrying capacity, and the
population was starting to level off.
The solution to the logistic differential equation has a point of inflection. To find this point, set the second derivative
equal to zero:

Notice that if
then this quantity is undefined, and the graph does not have a point of inflection. In the logistic
graph, the point of inflection can be seen as the point where the graph changes from concave up to concave down. This
is where the “leveling off” starts to occur, because the net growth rate becomes slower as the population starts to
approach the carrying capacity.

4.5.3 Solve applied problems involving first-order linear differential equations.
Earlier, we studied an application of a first-order differential equation that involved solving for the velocity of an object.
In particular, if a ball is thrown upward with an initial velocity of
ft/s, then an initial-value problem that describes the
velocity of the ball after
seconds is given by
This model assumes that the only force acting on the ball is gravity. Now we add to the problem by allowing for the
possibility of air resistance acting on the ball.
Air resistance always acts in the direction opposite to motion. Therefore if an object is rising, air resistance acts in a
downward direction. If the object is falling, air resistance acts in an upward direction (Figure 4.24). There is no exact
relationship between the velocity of an object and the air resistance acting on it. For very small objects, air resistance is

proportional to velocity; that is, the force due to air resistance is numerically equal to some constant
times
For larger
(e.g., baseball-sized) objects, depending on the shape, air resistance can be approximately proportional to the square of
the velocity. In fact, air resistance may be proportional to
or
or some other power of

*Figure 4.24 Forces acting on a moving baseball: gravity acts in a downward direction and air resistance acts in a direction*

opposite to the direction of motion.
We will work with the linear approximation for air resistance. If we assume
then the expression for the force
due to air resistance is given by
Therefore the sum of the forces acting on the object is equal to the sum of
the gravitational force and the force due to air resistance. This, in turn, is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its
acceleration at time
(Newton’s second law). This gives us the differential equation
Finally, we impose an initial condition

These equations are nonlinear because of terms like

Integrating Factors
We now develop a solution technique for any first-order linear differential equation. We start with the standard form of a
first-order linear differential equation:
The first term on the left-hand side of Equation 4.15 is the derivative of the unknown function, and the second term is
the product of a known function with the unknown function. This is somewhat reminiscent of the product rule from the
Differentiation Rules (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/3-3-differentiation-rules) section. If we
multiply Equation 4.16 by a yet-to-be-determined function
then the equation becomes

Applications of First-order Linear Differential Equations
We look at two different applications of first-order linear differential equations. The first involves air resistance as it
relates to objects that are rising or falling; the second involves an electrical circuit. Other applications are numerous, but
most are solved in a similar fashion.

Free fall with air resistance
We discussed air resistance at the beginning of this section. The next example shows how to apply this concept for a ball
in vertical motion. Other factors can affect the force of air resistance, such as the size and shape of the object, but we
ignore them here.

The ball reaches its maximum height when the velocity is equal to zero. The reason is that when the velocity is
positive, it is rising, and when it is negative, it is falling. Therefore when it is zero, it is neither rising nor falling, and
is at its maximum height:

A source of electromotive force (e.g., a battery or generator) produces a flow of current in a closed circuit, and this
current produces a voltage drop across each resistor, inductor, and capacitor in the circuit. Kirchhoff’s Loop Rule states
that the sum of the voltage drops across resistors, inductors, and capacitors is equal to the total electromotive force in a
closed circuit. We have the following three results:
1.
The voltage drop across a resistor is given by

### 4.1 Basics of Differential Equations •

A differential equation is an equation involving a function
and one or more of its derivatives. A solution is a
function
that satisfies the differential equation when
and its derivatives are substituted into the
equation.
•
The order of a differential equation is the highest order of any derivative of the unknown function that appears in
the equation.
•
A differential equation coupled with an initial value is called an initial-value problem. To solve an initial-value
problem, first find the general solution to the differential equation, then determine the value of the constant. Initialvalue problems have many applications in science and engineering.

•
The method of separation of variables is used to find the general solution to a separable differential equation.

### 4.4 The Logistic Equation •

When studying population functions, different assumptions—such as exponential growth, logistic growth, or
threshold population—lead to different rates of growth.
•
The logistic differential equation incorporates the concept of a carrying capacity. This value is a limiting value on the
population for any given environment.
•
The logistic differential equation can be solved for any positive growth rate, initial population, and carrying capacity.

### 5.6 Ratio and Root Tests Introduction

The Koch snowflake is constructed from an infinite number of nonoverlapping equilateral triangles. Consequently, we
can express its area as a sum of infinitely many terms. How do we add an infinite number of terms? Can a sum of an
infinite number of terms be finite? To answer these questions, we need to introduce the concept of an infinite series, a
sum with infinitely many terms. Having defined the necessary tools, we will be able to calculate the area of the Koch
snowflake (see Example 5.8).
The topic of infinite series may seem unrelated to differential and integral calculus. In fact, an infinite series whose terms
involve powers of a variable is a powerful tool that we can use to express functions as “infinite polynomials.” We can use
infinite series to evaluate complicated functions, approximate definite integrals, and create new functions. In addition,
infinite series are used to solve differential equations that model physical behavior, from tiny electronic circuits to Earthorbiting satellites.

### 5.1 Sequences Learning Objectives

5.1.1 Find the formula for the general term of a sequence.
5.1.2 Calculate the limit of a sequence if it exists.
5.1.3 Determine the convergence or divergence of a given sequence.
In this section, we introduce sequences and define what it means for a sequence to converge or diverge. We show how
to find limits of sequences that converge, often by using the properties of limits for functions discussed earlier. We close
this section with the Monotone Convergence Theorem, a tool we can use to prove that certain types of sequences
converge.
Terminology of Sequences
To work with this new topic, we need some new terms and definitions. First, an infinite sequence is an ordered list of
numbers of the form
Each of the numbers in the sequence is called a term. The symbol
is called the index variable for the sequence. We use
the notation
∞
to denote this sequence. A similar notation is used for sets, but a sequence is an ordered list, whereas a set is not
ordered. Because a particular number
exists for each positive integer
we can also define a sequence as a function
whose domain is the set of positive integers.
Let’s consider the infinite, ordered list
This is a sequence in which the first, second, and third terms are given by
and
You can probably
see that the terms in this sequence have the following pattern:
Assuming this pattern continues, we can write the
term in the sequence by the explicit formula
Using this
notation, we can write this sequence as
∞
Alternatively, we can describe this sequence in a different way. Since each term is twice the previous term, this sequence
can be defined recursively by expressing the
term
in terms of the previous term
In particular, we can define
this sequence as the sequence
where
and for all
each term
is defined by the recurrence
relation
Definition
An infinite sequence
is an ordered list of numbers of the form
The subscript
is called the index variable of the sequence. Each number
is a term of the sequence. Sometimes
sequences are defined by explicit formulas, in which case
for some function
defined over the positive
integers. In other cases, sequences are defined by using a recurrence relation. In a recurrence relation, one term (or
more) of the sequence is given explicitly, and subsequent terms are defined in terms of earlier terms in the sequence.
Note that the index does not have to start at
but could start with other integers. For example, a sequence given by
the explicit formula
could start at
in which case the sequence would be
Similarly, for a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, the term
may be given explicitly, and the terms

may be defined in terms of
Since a sequence
has exactly one value for each positive integer
it can be
described as a function whose domain is the set of positive integers. As a result, it makes sense to discuss the graph of a
sequence. The graph of a sequence
consists of all points
for all positive integers

*Figure 5.2 shows the*

graph of

*Figure 5.2 The plotted points are a graph of the sequence*

Two types of sequences occur often and are given special names: arithmetic sequences and geometric sequences. In an
arithmetic sequence, the difference between every pair of consecutive terms is the same. For example, consider the
sequence
You can see that the difference between every consecutive pair of terms is
Assuming that this pattern continues, this
sequence is an arithmetic sequence. It can be described by using the recurrence relation
Note that
Thus the sequence can also be described using the explicit formula
In general, an arithmetic sequence is any sequence of the form
In a geometric sequence, the ratio of every pair of consecutive terms is the same. For example, consider the sequence
We see that the ratio of any term to the preceding term is
Assuming this pattern continues, this sequence is a
geometric sequence. It can be defined recursively as
Alternatively, since

### 5.1 • Sequences 375



we see that the sequence can be described by using the explicit formula
The sequence
that we discussed earlier is a geometric sequence, where the ratio of any term to the previous term
is
In general, a geometric sequence is any sequence of the form

#### Example 5.1: Finding Explicit Formulas

For each of the following sequences, find an explicit formula for the
term of the sequence.
a.
b.

**Solution:**

a.
First, note that the sequence is alternating from negative to positive. The odd terms in the sequence are negative,
and the even terms are positive. Therefore, the
term includes a factor of
Next, consider the sequence of
numerators
and the sequence of denominators
We can see that both of these sequences
are arithmetic sequences. The
term in the sequence of numerators is
and the
term in the sequence of
denominators is
Therefore, the sequence can be described by the explicit formula
b.
The sequence of numerators
is a geometric sequence. The numerator of the
term is
The
sequence of denominators
is an arithmetic sequence. The denominator of the
term is
Therefore, we can describe the sequence by the explicit formula

Limit of a Sequence
A fundamental question that arises regarding infinite sequences is the behavior of the terms as
gets larger. Since a
sequence is a function defined on the positive integers, it makes sense to discuss the limit of the terms as
∞For
example, consider the following four sequences and their different behaviors as
∞(see Figure 5.3):
a.
The terms
become arbitrarily large as

From these examples, we see several possibilities for the behavior of the terms of a sequence as
∞In two of the
sequences, the terms approach a finite number as
∞In the other two sequences, the terms do not. If the terms of
a sequence approach a finite number
as
∞we say that the sequence is a convergent sequence and the real
number
is the limit of the sequence. We can give an informal definition here.
Definition
Given a sequence
if the terms
become arbitrarily close to a finite number
as

we say
is a convergent sequence and
is the limit of the sequence. In this case, we write
∞
If a sequence
is not convergent, we say it is a divergent sequence.
From Figure 5.3, we see that the terms in the sequence
are becoming arbitrarily close to

very large. We conclude that
is a convergent sequence and its limit is
In contrast, from Figure 5.3, we see
that the terms in the sequence
are not approaching a finite number as
becomes larger. We say that

a divergent sequence.
In the informal definition for the limit of a sequence, we used the terms “arbitrarily close” and “sufficiently large.”

Although these phrases help illustrate the meaning of a converging sequence, they are somewhat vague. To be more
precise, we now present the more formal definition of limit for a sequence and show these ideas graphically in Figure
5.4.
Definition
A sequence
converges to a real number
if for all
there exists an integer
such that
if
The number
is the limit of the sequence and we write
∞
In this case, we say the sequence
is a convergent sequence. If a sequence does not converge, it is a divergent
sequence, and we say the limit does not exist.
We remark that the convergence or divergence of a sequence
depends only on what happens to the terms
as
∞Therefore, if a finite number of terms
are placed before
to create a new sequence
this new sequence will converge if
converges and diverge if
diverges. Further, if the sequence

to
this new sequence will also converge to

As defined above, if a sequence does not converge, it is said to be a divergent sequence. For example, the sequences
and
shown in Figure 5.4 diverge. However, different sequences can diverge in different ways. The
sequence
diverges because the terms alternate between
and
but do not approach one value as

On the other hand, the sequence
diverges because the terms

∞We say the sequence
diverges to infinity and write

∞It is important to recognize that this notation does not imply
the limit of the sequence
exists. The sequence is, in fact, divergent. Writing that the limit is infinity is intended
only to provide more information about why the sequence is divergent. A sequence can also diverge to negative infinity.
For example, the sequence
diverges to negative infinity because

Bounded Sequences
We now turn our attention to one of the most important theorems involving sequences: the Monotone Convergence
Theorem. Before stating the theorem, we need to introduce some terminology and motivation. We begin by defining
what it means for a sequence to be bounded.
Definition
A sequence
is bounded above if there exists a real number
such that
for all positive integers
A sequence
is bounded below if there exists a real number
such that
for all positive integers
A sequence
is a bounded sequence if it is bounded above and bounded below.
If a sequence is not bounded, it is an unbounded sequence.
For example, the sequence
is bounded above because
for all positive integers
It is also bounded below
because
for all positive integers n. Therefore,
is a bounded sequence. On the other hand, consider the
sequence
Because
for all
the sequence is bounded below. However, the sequence is not bounded
above. Therefore,
is an unbounded sequence.
We now discuss the relationship between boundedness and convergence. Suppose a sequence
is unbounded. Then
it is not bounded above, or not bounded below, or both. In either case, there are terms
that are arbitrarily large in
magnitude as
gets larger. As a result, the sequence
cannot converge. Therefore, being bounded is a necessary
condition for a sequence to converge.

#### Theorem 5.5: 

Convergent Sequences Are Bounded
If a sequence
converges, then it is bounded.
Note that a sequence being bounded is not a sufficient condition for a sequence to converge. For example, the sequence
is bounded, but the sequence diverges because the sequence oscillates between
and
and never
approaches a finite number. We now discuss a sufficient (but not necessary) condition for a bounded sequence to
converge.
Consider a bounded sequence
Suppose the sequence
is increasing. That is,
Since the
sequence is increasing, the terms are not oscillating. Therefore, there are two possibilities. The sequence could diverge
to infinity, or it could converge. However, since the sequence is bounded, it is bounded above and the sequence cannot
diverge to infinity. We conclude that
converges. For example, consider the sequence
Since this sequence is increasing and bounded above, it converges. Next, consider the sequence
Even though the sequence is not increasing for all values of
we see that
Therefore, starting
with the eighth term,
the sequence is increasing. In this case, we say the sequence is eventually increasing.
Since the sequence is bounded above, it converges. It is also true that if a sequence is decreasing (or eventually
decreasing) and bounded below, it also converges.

Definition
A sequence

A sequence

if
A sequence

if it is increasing for all
or decreasing for all
We now have the necessary definitions to state the Monotone Convergence Theorem, which gives a sufficient condition
for convergence of a sequence.

#### Theorem 5.6: 

Monotone Convergence Theorem
If
is a bounded sequence and there exists a positive integer
such that
is monotone for all
then
converges.
The proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of this text. Instead, we provide a graph to show intuitively why this
theorem makes sense (Figure 5.7).

*Figure 5.7 Since the sequence*

is increasing and bounded above, it must converge.
In the following example, we show how the Monotone Convergence Theorem can be used to prove convergence of a
sequence.

For each of the following sequences, use the Monotone Convergence Theorem to show the sequence converges and find

5.2.1 Explain the meaning of the sum of an infinite series.
5.2.2 Calculate the sum of a geometric series.
5.2.3 Evaluate a telescoping series.
We have seen that a sequence is an ordered set of terms. If you add these terms together, you get a series. In this
section we define an infinite series and show how series are related to sequences. We also define what it means for a
series to converge or diverge. We introduce one of the most important types of series: the geometric series. We will use
geometric series in the next chapter to write certain functions as polynomials with an infinite number of terms. This
process is important because it allows us to evaluate, differentiate, and integrate complicated functions by using
polynomials that are easier to handle. We also discuss the harmonic series, arguably the most interesting divergent
series because it just fails to converge.
Sums and Series
An infinite series is a sum of infinitely many terms and is written in the form
∞
But what does this mean? We cannot add an infinite number of terms in the same way we can add a finite number of
terms. Instead, the value of an infinite series is defined in terms of the limit of partial sums. A partial sum of an infinite
series is a finite sum of the form
To see how we use partial sums to evaluate infinite series, consider the following example. Suppose oil is seeping into a
lake such that
gallons enters the lake the first week. During the second week, an additional
gallons of oil
enters the lake. The third week,
more gallons enters the lake. Assume this pattern continues such that each week
half as much oil enters the lake as did the previous week. If this continues forever, what can we say about the amount of

oil in the lake? Will the amount of oil continue to get arbitrarily large, or is it possible that it approaches some finite
amount? To answer this question, we look at the amount of oil in the lake after
weeks. Letting
denote the amount
of oil in the lake (measured in thousands of gallons) after
weeks, we see that
Looking at this pattern, we see that the amount of oil in the lake (in thousands of gallons) after
weeks is
We are interested in what happens as
∞Symbolically, the amount of oil in the lake as
∞is given by the infinite
series
∞
At the same time, as
∞the amount of oil in the lake can be calculated by evaluating
∞
Therefore, the
behavior of the infinite series can be determined by looking at the behavior of the sequence of partial sums
If the
sequence of partial sums
converges, we say that the infinite series converges, and its sum is given by
∞
If
the sequence
diverges, we say the infinite series diverges. We now turn our attention to determining the limit of
this sequence
First, simplifying some of these partial sums, we see that
Plotting some of these values in Figure 5.10, it appears that the sequence
could be approaching 2.

*Figure 5.10 The graph shows the sequence of partial sums*

It appears that the sequence is approaching the value
Let’s look for more convincing evidence. In the following table, we list the values of
for several values of

These data supply more evidence suggesting that the sequence
converges to
Later we will provide an analytic
argument that can be used to prove that
∞
For now, we rely on the numerical and graphical data to convince
ourselves that the sequence of partial sums does actually converge to
Since this sequence of partial sums converges
to
we say the infinite series converges to
and write
∞
Returning to the question about the oil in the lake, since this infinite series converges to
we conclude that the amount
of oil in the lake will get arbitrarily close to
gallons as the amount of time gets sufficiently large.
This series is an example of a geometric series. We discuss geometric series in more detail later in this section. First, we
summarize what it means for an infinite series to converge.
Definition
An infinite series is an expression of the form
∞
For each positive integer
the sum
is called the
partial sum of the infinite series. The partial sums form a sequence
If the sequence of partial
sums converges to a real number
the infinite series converges. If we can describe the convergence of a series to

The Harmonic Series
A useful series to know about is the harmonic series. The harmonic series is defined as
This series is interesting because it diverges, but it diverges very slowly. By this we mean that the terms in the sequence
of partial sums
approach infinity, but do so very slowly. We will show that the series diverges, but first we illustrate
the slow growth of the terms in the sequence
in the following table.
Even after
terms, the partial sum is still relatively small. From this table, it is not clear that this series actually
diverges. However, we can show analytically that the sequence of partial sums diverges, and therefore the series
diverges.
To show that the sequence of partial sums diverges, we show that the sequence of partial sums is unbounded. We begin
by writing the first several partial sums:

therefore diverges. In the previous section, we stated that convergent sequences are bounded. Consequently, since

Analysis
The Koch snowflake is interesting because it has finite area, yet infinite perimeter. Although at first this may seem
impossible, recall that you have seen similar examples earlier in the text. For example, consider the region bounded by
the curve
and the
-axis on the interval
∞
Since the improper integral

converges, the area of this region is finite, even though the perimeter is infinite.
Telescoping Series
Consider the series

We discussed this series in Example 5.7, showing that the series converges by writing
out the first several partial sums
and noticing that they are all of the form
Here we use a
different technique to show that this series converges. By using partial fractions, we can write
Therefore, the series can be written as

Writing out the first several terms in the sequence of partial sums

In general,
We notice that the middle terms cancel each other out, leaving only the first and last terms. In a sense, the series
collapses like a spyglass with tubes that disappear into each other to shorten the telescope. For this reason, we call a
series that has this property a telescoping series. For this series, since
and

Definition
A telescoping series is a series in which most of the terms cancel in each of the partial sums, leaving only some of
the first terms and some of the last terms.
For example, any series of the form
∞
is a telescoping series. We can see this by writing out some of the partial sums. In particular, we see that
In general, the kth partial sum of this series is
Since the kth partial sum can be simplified to the difference of these two terms, the sequence of partial sums
will
converge if and only if the sequence
converges. Moreover, if the sequence
converges to some finite number
then the sequence of partial sums converges to

### 5.3 The Divergence and Integral Tests Learning Objectives

5.3.1 Use the divergence test to determine whether a series converges or diverges.
5.3.2 Use the integral test to determine the convergence of a series.
5.3.3 Estimate the value of a series by finding bounds on its remainder term.
In the previous section, we determined the convergence or divergence of several series by explicitly calculating the limit
of the sequence of partial sums
In practice, explicitly calculating this limit can be difficult or impossible. Luckily,
several tests exist that allow us to determine convergence or divergence for many types of series. In this section, we
discuss two of these tests: the divergence test and the integral test. We will examine several other tests in the rest of this
chapter and then summarize how and when to use them.
Divergence Test
A series
∞
being convergent is equivalent to the convergence of the sequence of partial sums (
) as

To verify this, notice that from the algebraic properties,

Therefore, if

∞An important consequence of this fact is the following
statement:
This test is known as the divergence test because it provides a way of proving that a series diverges.

#### Theorem 5.8: 

Divergence Test
If
∞
or
∞
does not exist, then the series
∞
diverges.
It is important to note that the converse of this theorem is not true. That is, if
∞
we cannot make any
conclusion about the convergence of
∞
For example,
∞
but the harmonic series
∞
diverges.
In this section and the remaining sections of this chapter, we show many more examples of such series. Consequently,
although we can use the divergence test to show that a series diverges, we cannot use it to prove that a series
converges. Specifically, if
the divergence test is inconclusive.

What does the divergence test tell us about the series
∞
Integral Test
In the previous section, we proved that the harmonic series diverges by looking at the sequence of partial sums
and showing that
for all positive integers
In this section we use a different technique to prove the
divergence of the harmonic series. This technique is important because it is used to prove the divergence or
convergence of many other series. This test, called the integral test, compares an infinite sum to an improper integral.
It is important to note that this test can only be applied when we are considering a series whose terms are all positive.
To illustrate how the integral test works, use the harmonic series as an example. In Figure 5.12, we depict the harmonic
series by sketching a sequence of rectangles with areas
along with the function
From the
graph, we see that
Therefore, for each

consequently, the series
∞
also diverges.

*Figure 5.12 The sum of the areas of the rectangles is greater than the area between the curve*

and the
-axis
for
Since the area bounded by the curve is infinite (as calculated by an improper integral), the sum of the areas of
the rectangles is also infinite.
Now consider the series
∞
We show how an integral can be used to prove that this series converges. In Figure
5.13, we sketch a sequence of rectangles with areas
along with the function
From the graph
we see that

### 5.3 • The Divergence and Integral Tests 415



Therefore, for each

partial sum

We conclude that the sequence of partial sums
is bounded. We also see that
is an increasing sequence:
Since
is increasing and bounded, by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it converges. Therefore, the series
∞
converges.

*Figure 5.13 The sum of the areas of the rectangles is less than the sum of the area of the first rectangle and the area*

between the curve
and the
-axis for
Since the area bounded by the curve is finite, the sum of the
areas of the rectangles is also finite.
We can extend this idea to prove convergence or divergence for many different series. Suppose

with positive terms
such that there exists a continuous, positive, decreasing function
where
for all
positive integers. Then, as in Figure 5.14(a), for any integer
the

Therefore, if
∞

is bounded. Since

sequence, if it is also a bounded sequence, then by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, it converges. We conclude that
if
∞
converges, then the series
∞
also converges. On the other hand, from Figure 5.14(b), for any
integer
the
partial sum

If

5.4.1 Use the comparison test to test a series for convergence.
5.4.2 Use the limit comparison test to determine convergence of a series.
We have seen that the integral test allows us to determine the convergence or divergence of a series by comparing it to
a related improper integral. In this section, we show how to use comparison tests to determine the convergence or
divergence of a series by comparing it to a series whose convergence or divergence is known. Typically these tests are
used to determine convergence of series that are similar to geometric series or p-series.
Comparison Test
In the preceding two sections, we discussed two large classes of series: geometric series and p-series. We know exactly
when these series converge and when they diverge. Here we show how to use the convergence or divergence of these
series to prove convergence or divergence for other series, using a method called the comparison test.
For example, consider the series
∞
This series looks similar to the convergent series

Since the terms in each of the series are positive, the sequence of partial sums for each series is monotone increasing.
Furthermore, since
for all positive integers
the
partial sum

To use the comparison test to determine the convergence or divergence of a series

it is necessary to find a
suitable series with which to compare it. Since we know the convergence properties of geometric series and p-series,
these series are often used. If there exists an integer
such that for all

corresponding term of a known convergent series, then

5.5.1 Use the alternating series test to test an alternating series for convergence.
5.5.2 Estimate the sum of an alternating series.
5.5.3 Explain the meaning of absolute convergence and conditional convergence.
So far in this chapter, we have primarily discussed series with positive terms. In this section we introduce alternating
series—those series whose terms alternate in sign. We will show in a later chapter that these series often arise when
studying power series. After defining alternating series, we introduce the alternating series test to determine whether
such a series converges.
The Alternating Series Test
A series whose terms alternate between positive and negative values is an alternating series. For example, the series
and
are both alternating series.
Definition
Any series whose terms alternate between positive and negative values is called an alternating series. An alternating
series can be written in the form
or
Where
for all positive integers n.
Series (1), shown in Equation 5.11, is a geometric series. Since
the series converges. Series (2), shown in
Equation 5.12, is called the alternating harmonic series. We will show that whereas the harmonic series diverges, the
alternating harmonic series converges.
To prove this, we look at the sequence of partial sums
(Figure 5.17).
Proof
Consider the odd terms

series

Definition
A series

convergence if

As shown by the alternating harmonic series, a series

Thus, applying Theorem 5.13, the series cannot converge absolutely. Moreover, because of the alternating series
test, we can see that the series converges.
We can conclude that

Since

therefore

5.20
Determine whether the series

converges absolutely, converges conditionally,
or diverges.
To see the difference between absolute and conditional convergence, look at what happens when we rearrange the
terms of the alternating harmonic series
∞
We show that we can rearrange the terms so that the new
series diverges. Certainly if we rearrange the terms of a finite sum, the sum does not change. When we work with an
infinite sum, however, interesting things can happen.
Begin by adding enough of the positive terms to produce a sum that is larger than some real number
For
example, let
and find an integer
such that
(We can do this because the series
∞
diverges to infinity.) Then subtract
Then add more positive
terms until the sum reaches 100. That is, find another integer
such that
Then subtract
Continuing in this way, we have found a way of rearranging the terms in the alternating harmonic
series so that the sequence of partial sums for the rearranged series is unbounded and therefore diverges.
The terms in the alternating harmonic series can also be rearranged so that the new series converges to a different
value. In Example 5.22, we show how to rearrange the terms to create a new series that converges to
We point
out that the alternating harmonic series can be rearranged to create a series that converges to any real number

In general, any series

that converges conditionally can be rearranged so that the new series diverges or
converges to a different real number. A series that converges absolutely does not have this property. For any series

is the same for any rearrangement of the terms. This result is

### 5.6 Ratio and Root Tests Learning Objectives

5.6.1 Use the ratio test to determine absolute convergence of a series.
5.6.2 Use the root test to determine absolute convergence of a series.
5.6.3 Describe a strategy for testing the convergence of a given series.
In this section, we prove the last two series convergence tests: the ratio test and the root test. These tests are particularly
nice because they do not require us to find a comparable series. The ratio test will be especially useful in the discussion
of power series in the next chapter.
Throughout this chapter, we have seen that no single convergence test works for all series. Therefore, at the end of this
section we discuss a strategy for choosing which convergence test to use for a given series.
Ratio Test
Consider a series
∞
From our earlier discussion and examples, we know that
∞
is not a sufficient condition
for the series to converge. Not only do we need
but we need
quickly enough. For example, consider the
series
∞
and the series
∞
We know that
and
However, only the series
∞
converges.
The series
∞
diverges because the terms in the sequence
do not approach zero fast enough as
∞Here
we introduce the ratio test, which provides a way of measuring how fast the terms of a series approach zero.

The ratio test is particularly useful for series whose terms contain factorials or exponentials, where the ratio of terms
simplifies the expression. The ratio test is convenient because it does not require us to find a comparative series. The
drawback is that the test sometimes does not provide any information regarding convergence.

5.22
Use the root test to determine whether the series
∞
converges or diverges.
Choosing a Convergence Test
At this point, we have a long list of convergence tests. However, not all tests can be used for all series. When given a
series, we must determine which test is the best to use. Here is a strategy for finding the best test to apply.
Problem-Solving Strategy
Choosing a Convergence Test for a Series
Consider a series
∞
In the steps below, we outline a strategy for determining whether the series converges.
1.
Is
∞
a familiar series? For example, is it the harmonic series (which diverges) or the alternating harmonic
series (which converges)? Is it a
or geometric series? If so, check the power
or the ratio
to
determine if the series converges.
2.
Is it an alternating series? Are we interested in absolute convergence or just convergence? If we are just
interested in whether the series converges, apply the alternating series test. If we are interested in absolute
convergence, proceed to step
considering the series of absolute values
∞
3.
Is the series similar to a
or geometric series? If so, try the comparison test or limit comparison test.
4.
Do the terms in the series contain a factorial or power? If the terms are powers such that
try the root
test first. Otherwise, try the ratio test first.
5.
Use the divergence test. If this test does not provide any information, try the integral test.

Therefore, it seems reasonable to apply the comparison test or limit comparison test using the series
∞
Using
the limit comparison test, we see that
∞
∞
Since the series
∞
diverges, this series diverges as well.
b.
Step 1.The series is not a familiar series.
Step 2. The series is alternating. Since we are interested in absolute convergence, consider the series
∞
Step 3. The series is not similar to a p-series or geometric series.
Step 4. Since each term contains a factorial, apply the ratio test. We see that
∞
∞

Therefore, this series converges, and we conclude that the original series converges absolutely, and thus converges.
c.
Step 1. The series is not a familiar series.
Step 2. It is not an alternating series.
Step 3. There is no obvious series with which to compare this series.
Step 4. There is no factorial. There is a power, but it is not an ideal situation for the root test.
Step 5. To apply the divergence test, we calculate that

Therefore, by the divergence test, the series diverges.

Step 2. It is not an alternating series.

Step 4. Since each term is a power of

### 6.3 Taylor and Maclaurin Series


### 6.4 Working with Taylor Series Introduction

When winning a lottery, sometimes an individual has an option of receiving winnings in one lump-sum payment or
receiving smaller payments over fixed time intervals. For example, you might have the option of receiving 20 million
dollars today or receiving 1.5 million dollars each year for the next 20 years. Which is the better deal? Certainly 1.5
million dollars over 20 years is equivalent to 30 million dollars. However, receiving the 20 million dollars today would
allow you to invest the money.
Alternatively, what if you were guaranteed to receive 1 million dollars every year indefinitely (extending to your heirs) or
receive 20 million dollars today. Which would be the better deal? To answer these questions, you need to know how to
use infinite series to calculate the value of periodic payments over time in terms of today’s dollars (see Example 6.7).
An infinite series of the form
∞
is known as a power series. Since the terms contain the variable x, power series
can be used to define functions. They can be used to represent given functions, but they are also important because they
allow us to write functions that cannot be expressed any other way than as “infinite polynomials.” In addition, power
series can be easily differentiated and integrated, thus being useful in solving differential equations and integrating
complicated functions. An infinite series can also be truncated, resulting in a finite polynomial that we can use to

approximate functional values. Power series have applications in a variety of fields, including physics, chemistry, biology,
and economics. As we will see in this chapter, representing functions using power series allows us to solve mathematical
problems that cannot be solved with other techniques.

### 6.1 Power Series and Functions Learning Objectives

6.1.1 Identify a power series and provide examples of them.
6.1.2 Determine the radius of convergence and interval of convergence of a power series.
6.1.3 Use a power series to represent a function.
A power series is a type of series with terms involving a variable. More specifically, if the variable is x, then all the terms
of the series involve powers of x. As a result, a power series can be thought of as an infinite polynomial. Power series are
used to represent common functions and also to define new functions. In this section we define power series and show
how to determine when a power series converges and when it diverges. We also show how to represent certain
functions using power series.
Form of a Power Series
A series of the form
∞
where x is a variable and the coefficients cn are constants, is known as a power series. The series

The series
∞
is a power series centered at
Convergence of a Power Series
Since the terms in a power series involve a variable x, the series may converge for certain values of x and diverge for
other values of x. For a power series centered at
the value of the series at
is given by
Therefore, a power
series always converges at its center. Some power series converge only at that value of x. Most power series, however,
converge for more than one value of x. In that case, the power series either converges for all real numbers x or
converges for all x in a finite interval. For example, the geometric series
∞
converges for all x in the interval
but diverges for all x outside that interval. We now summarize these three possibilities for a general power series.

Therefore, the set S must be a bounded set,
which means that it must have a smallest upper bound. (This fact follows from the Least Upper Bound Property for the
real numbers, which is beyond the scope of this text and is covered in real analysis courses.) Call that smallest upper

The set of values x for which the series
∞
converges is known as the interval of
convergence. Since the series diverges for all values x where
the length of the interval is 2R, and therefore,
the radius of the interval is R. The value R is called the radius of convergence. For example, since the series

converges for all values x in the interval
and diverges for all values x such that
the interval of
convergence of this series is
Since the length of the interval is 2, the radius of convergence is 1.

Representing Functions as Power Series
Being able to represent a function by an “infinite polynomial” is a powerful tool. Polynomial functions are the easiest
functions to analyze, since they only involve the basic arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. If we can represent a complicated function by an infinite polynomial, we can use the polynomial representation
to differentiate or integrate it. In addition, we can use a truncated version of the polynomial expression to approximate
values of the function. So, the question is, when can we represent a function by a power series?
Consider again the geometric series
Recall that the geometric series
converges if and only if
In that case, it converges to
Therefore, if

As a result, we are able to represent the function

of f with the graphs of several of the partial sums of this infinite series.

### 6.2 Properties of Power Series Learning Objectives

6.2.1 Combine power series by addition or subtraction.
6.2.2 Create a new power series by multiplication by a power of the variable or a constant, or by substitution.
6.2.3 Multiply two power series together.
6.2.4 Differentiate and integrate power series term-by-term.
In the preceding section on power series and functions we showed how to represent certain functions using power
series. In this section we discuss how power series can be combined, differentiated, or integrated to create new power
series. This capability is particularly useful for a couple of reasons. First, it allows us to find power series representations
for certain elementary functions, by writing those functions in terms of functions with known power series. For example,
given the power series representation for
we can find a power series representation for
Second, being able to create power series allows us to define new functions that cannot be written in terms of
elementary functions. This capability is particularly useful for solving differential equations for which there is no solution
in terms of elementary functions.
Combining Power Series
If we have two power series with the same interval of convergence, we can add or subtract the two series to create a
new power series, also with the same interval of convergence. Similarly, we can multiply a power series by a power of x
or evaluate a power series at
for a positive integer m to create a new power series. Being able to do this allows us to
find power series representations for certain functions by using power series representations of other functions. For
example, since we know the power series representation for
we can find power series representations for
related functions, such as
In Combining Power Series we state results regarding addition or subtraction of power series, composition of a power
series, and multiplication of a power series by a power of the variable. For simplicity, we state the theorem for power
series centered at
Similar results hold for power series centered at

Recall the questions posed in the chapter opener about which is the better way of receiving payouts from lottery
winnings. We now revisit those questions and show how to use series to compare values of payments over time with a
lump sum payment today. We will compute how much future payments are worth in terms of today’s dollars, assuming

we have the ability to invest winnings and earn interest. The value of future payments in terms of today’s dollars is
known as the present value of those payments.

#### Example 6.7: Chapter Opener: Present Value of Future Winnings


*Figure 6.4 (credit: modification of work by Robert Huffstutter, Flickr)*

Suppose you win the lottery and are given the following three options: (1) Receive 20 million dollars today; (2) receive 1.5
million dollars per year over the next 20 years; or (3) receive 1 million dollars per year indefinitely (being passed on to
your heirs). Which is the best deal, assuming that the annual interest rate is 5%? We answer this by working through the
following sequence of questions.
a.
How much is the 1.5 million dollars received annually over the course of 20 years worth in terms of today’s dollars,
assuming an annual interest rate of 5%?
b.
Use the answer to part a. to find a general formula for the present value of payments of C dollars received each year
over the next n years, assuming an average annual interest rate r.
c.
Find a formula for the present value if annual payments of C dollars continue indefinitely, assuming an average
annual interest rate r.
d.
Use the answer to part c. to determine the present value of 1 million dollars paid annually indefinitely.
e.
Use your answers to parts a. and d. to determine which of the three options is best.

**Solution:**

a.
Consider the payment of 1.5 million dollars made at the end of the first year. If you were able to receive that
payment today instead of one year from now, you could invest that money and earn 5% interest. Therefore, the
present value of that money P1 satisfies
We conclude that
Similarly, consider the payment of 1.5 million dollars made at the end of the second year. If you were able to receive
that payment today, you could invest that money for two years, earning 5% interest, compounded annually.
Therefore, the present value of that money P2 satisfies
We conclude that
The value of the future payments today is the sum of the present values
of each of those annual
payments. The present value Pk satisfies

Therefore,
b.
Using the result from part a. we see that the present value P of C dollars paid annually over the course of n years,
assuming an annual interest rate r, is given by
c.
Using the result from part b. we see that the present value of an annuity that continues indefinitely is given by the
infinite series
∞
We can view the present value as a power series in r, which converges as long as
Since
this series
converges. Rewriting the series as
∞
we recognize this series as the power series for
We conclude that the present value of this annuity is
d.
From the result to part c. we conclude that the present value P of
paid out every year
indefinitely, assuming an annual interest rate
is given by
e.
From part a. we see that receiving $1.5 million dollars over the course of 20 years is worth $18.693 million dollars in
today’s dollars. From part d. we see that receiving $1 million dollars per year indefinitely is worth $20 million dollars
in today’s dollars. Therefore, either receiving a lump-sum payment of $20 million dollars today or receiving $1
million dollars indefinitely have the same present value.
Multiplication of Power Series
We can also create new power series by multiplying power series. Being able to multiply two power series provides
another way of finding power series representations for functions.
The way we multiply them is similar to how we multiply polynomials. For example, suppose we want to multiply

How do we evaluate the indefinite integral
We know that, for a polynomial with a finite number of terms, we can evaluate the derivative by differentiating each term
separately. Similarly, we can evaluate the indefinite integral by integrating each term separately. Here we show that we

and
converges on I. As noted below, behavior at the endpoints of the interval must be investigated individually.
Evaluating the derivative and indefinite integral in this way is called term-by-term differentiation of a power series
and term-by-term integration of a power series, respectively. The ability to differentiate and integrate power series
term-by-term also allows us to use known power series representations to find power series representations for other
functions. For example, given the power series for

differentiation and integration of power series.

The proof of this result is beyond the scope of the text and is omitted. Note that although Term-by-Term Differentiation
and Integration for Power Series guarantees the same radius of convergence when a power series is differentiated or
integrated term-by-term, it says nothing about what happens at the endpoints. It is possible that the differentiated and
integrated power series have different behavior at the endpoints than does the original series. We see this behavior in
the next examples.

In the previous two sections we discussed how to find power series representations for certain types of

types of functions. In particular, we address the following questions: Which functions can be represented by power series
and how do we find such representations? If we can find a power series representation for a particular function

the series converges on some interval, how do we prove that the series actually converges to

Taylor’s Theorem with Remainder
Recall that the nth Taylor polynomial for a function

to determine if the Taylor series converges, we need to determine whether the sequence of Taylor polynomials
converges. However, not only do we want to know if the sequence of Taylor polynomials converges, we want to know if it
converges to
To answer this question, we define the remainder
as
For the sequence of Taylor polynomials to converge to
we need the remainder Rn to converge to zero. To determine if
Rn converges to zero, we introduce Taylor’s theorem with remainder. Not only is this theorem useful in proving that a
Taylor series converges to its related function, but it will also allow us to quantify how well the nth Taylor polynomial
approximates the function.
Here we look for a bound on

containing a and x, then the nth remainder Rn satisfies

We note that if

derivative
is the zero function, and the series
terminates. In addition, if
is a nonnegative integer, then Equation 6.8 for the coefficients agrees with Equation 6.6 for
the coefficients, and the formula for the binomial series agrees with Equation 6.7 for the finite binomial expansion. More

This equation is easily solved using
techniques discussed earlier in the text. For most differential equations, however, we do not yet have analytical tools to

Evaluating Nonelementary Integrals
Solving differential equations is one common application of power series. We now turn to a second application. We show
how power series can be used to evaluate integrals involving functions whose antiderivatives cannot be expressed using
elementary functions.
One integral that arises often in applications in probability theory is
Unfortunately, the antiderivative of the
integrand
is not an elementary function. By elementary function, we mean a function that can be written using a
finite number of algebraic combinations or compositions of exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, or power functions.
We remark that the term “elementary function” is not synonymous with noncomplicated function. For example, the
function
is an elementary function, although not a particularly simple-looking
function. Any integral of the form
where the antiderivative of
cannot be written as an elementary function
is considered a nonelementary integral.
Nonelementary integrals cannot be evaluated using the basic integration techniques discussed earlier. One way to
evaluate such integrals is by expressing the integrand as a power series and integrating term by term. We demonstrate
this technique by considering

An integral of this form is known as an elliptic integral of the first kind. Elliptic integrals originally arose when trying to
calculate the arc length of an ellipse. We now show how to use power series to approximate this integral.

rings in a tree.
The mathematical function that describes a spiral can be expressed using rectangular (or Cartesian) coordinates.
However, if we change our coordinate system to something that works a bit better with circular patterns, the function
becomes much simpler to describe. The polar coordinate system is well suited for describing curves of this type. How
can we use this coordinate system to describe spirals and other radial figures? (See Example 7.14.)
In this chapter we also study parametric equations, which give us a convenient way to describe curves, or to study the
position of a particle or object in two dimensions as a function of time. We will use parametric equations and polar
coordinates for describing many topics later in this text.

### 7.1 Parametric Equations Learning Objectives

7.1.1 Plot a curve described by parametric equations.
7.1.2 Convert the parametric equations of a curve into the form
7.1.3 Recognize the parametric equations of basic curves, such as a line and a circle.
7.1.4 Recognize the parametric equations of a cycloid.
In this section we examine parametric equations and their graphs. In the two-dimensional coordinate system,
parametric equations are useful for describing curves that are not necessarily functions. The parameter is an
independent variable that both x and y depend on, and as the parameter increases, the values of x and y trace out a path
along a plane curve. For example, if the parameter is t (a common choice), then t might represent time. Then x and y are
defined as functions of time, and
can describe the position in the plane of a given object as it moves along a
curved path.
Parametric Equations and Their Graphs
Consider the orbit of Earth around the Sun. Our year lasts approximately 365.25 days, but for this discussion we will use
365 days. On January 1 of each year, the physical location of Earth with respect to the Sun is nearly the same, except for
leap years, when the lag introduced by the extra
day of orbiting time is built into the calendar. We call January 1 “day 1”
of the year. Then, for example, day 31 is January 31, day 59 is February 28, and so on.
The number of the day in a year can be considered a variable that determines Earth’s position in its orbit. As Earth
revolves around the Sun, its physical location changes relative to the Sun. After one full year, we are back where we
started, and a new year begins. According to Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, the shape of the orbit is elliptical, with
the Sun at one focus of the ellipse. We study this idea in more detail in Conic Sections.

*Figure 7.2 Earth’s orbit around the Sun in one year.*


*Figure 7.2 depicts Earth’s orbit around the Sun during one year. The point labeled*

is one of the foci of the ellipse; the
other focus is occupied by the Sun. If we superimpose coordinate axes over this graph, then we can assign ordered pairs
to each point on the ellipse (Figure 7.3). Then each x value on the graph is a value of position as a function of time, and
each y value is also a value of position as a function of time. Therefore, each point on the graph corresponds to a value
of Earth’s position as a function of time.

We can determine the functions for
and
thereby parameterizing the orbit of Earth around the Sun. The
variable
is called an independent parameter and, in this context, represents time relative to the beginning of each year.
A curve in the
plane can be represented parametrically. The equations that are used to define the curve are called
parametric equations.
Definition
If x and y are continuous functions of t on an interval I, then the equations
are called parametric equations and t is called the parameter. The set of points
obtained as t varies over the
interval I is called the graph of the parametric equations. The graph of parametric equations is called a parametric
curve or plane curve, and is denoted by C.
Notice in this definition that x and y are used in two ways. The first is as functions of the independent variable t. As t
varies over the interval I, the functions
and
generate a set of ordered pairs
This set of ordered pairs
generates the graph of the parametric equations. In this second usage, to designate the ordered pairs, x and y are
variables. It is important to distinguish the variables x and y from the functions

Eliminating the Parameter
To better understand the graph of a curve represented parametrically, it is useful to rewrite the two equations as a single
equation relating the variables x and y. Then we can apply any previous knowledge of equations of curves in the plane to
identify the curve. For example, the equations describing the plane curve in Example 7.1b. are
Solving the second equation for t gives
This can be substituted into the first equation:
This equation describes x as a function of y. These steps give an example of eliminating the parameter. The graph of this
function is a parabola opening to the right. Recall that the plane curve started at
and ended at
These
terminations were due to the restriction on the parameter t.

resulting graph.

**Solution:**

a.
To eliminate the parameter, we can solve either of the equations for t. For example, solving the first equation for t
gives
Note that when we square both sides it is important to observe that
Substituting
this into
yields
This is the equation of a parabola opening upward. There is, however, a domain restriction because of the limits on
the parameter t. When

The graph of this plane
curve follows.

b.
Sometimes it is necessary to be a bit creative in eliminating the parameter. The parametric equations for this
example are
Solving either equation for t directly is not advisable because sine and cosine are not one-to-one functions. However,
dividing the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 (and suppressing the t) gives us
Now use the Pythagorean identity
and replace the expressions for

with the
equivalent expressions in terms of x and y. This gives

This is the equation of a horizontal ellipse centered at the origin, with semimajor axis 4 and semiminor axis 3 as

As t progresses from

a point on the curve traverses the ellipse once, in a counterclockwise direction. Recall
from the section opener that the orbit of Earth around the Sun is also elliptical. This is a perfect example of using
parameterized curves to model a real-world phenomenon.
7.2
Eliminate the parameter for the plane curve defined by the following parametric equations and describe
the resulting graph.
So far we have seen the method of eliminating the parameter, assuming we know a set of parametric equations that
describe a plane curve. What if we would like to start with the equation of a curve and determine a pair of parametric
equations for that curve? This is certainly possible, and in fact it is possible to do so in many different ways for a given
curve. The process is known as parameterization of a curve.

#### Example 7.3: Parameterizing a Curve

Find two different pairs of parametric equations to represent the graph of

**Solution:**

First, it is always possible to parameterize a curve by defining
then replacing x with t in the equation for
This gives the parameterization
Since there is no restriction on the domain in the original graph, there is no restriction on the values of t.
We have complete freedom in the choice for the second parameterization. For example, we can choose

Cycloids and Other Parametric Curves
Imagine going on a bicycle ride through the country. The tires stay in contact with the road and rotate in a predictable
pattern. Now suppose a very determined ant is tired after a long day and wants to get home. So he hangs onto the side
of the tire and gets a free ride. The path that this ant travels down a straight road is called a cycloid (Figure 7.9). A cycloid
generated by a circle (or bicycle wheel) of radius a is given by the parametric equations
To see why this is true, consider the path that the center of the wheel takes. The center moves along the x-axis at a
constant height equal to the radius of the wheel. If the radius is a, then the coordinates of the center can be given by the
equations
for any value of
Next, consider the ant, which rotates around the center along a circular path. If the bicycle is moving
from left to right then the wheels are rotating in a clockwise direction. A possible parameterization of the circular motion
of the ant (relative to the center of the wheel) is given by
(The negative sign is needed to reverse the orientation of the curve. If the negative sign were not there, we would have
to imagine the wheel rotating counterclockwise.) Adding these equations together gives the equations for the cycloid.

*Figure 7.9 A wheel traveling along a road without slipping; the point on the edge of the wheel traces out a cycloid.*

Now suppose that the bicycle wheel doesn’t travel along a straight road but instead moves along the inside of a larger
wheel, as in Figure 7.10. In this graph, the green circle is traveling around the blue circle in a counterclockwise direction.
A point on the edge of the green circle traces out the red graph, which is called a hypocycloid.

### 7.1 • Parametric Equations 543




*Figure 7.10 Graph of the hypocycloid described by the parametric equations shown.*

The general parametric equations for a hypocycloid are
These equations are a bit more complicated, but the derivation is somewhat similar to the equations for the cycloid. In
this case we assume the radius of the larger circle is a and the radius of the smaller circle is b. Then the center of the
wheel travels along a circle of radius
This fact explains the first term in each equation above. The period of the

The ratio
is related to the number of cusps on the graph (cusps are the corners or pointed ends of the graph), as
illustrated in Figure 7.11. This ratio can lead to some very interesting graphs, depending on whether or not the ratio is
rational. Figure 7.10 corresponds to

The result is a hypocycloid with four cusps. Figure 7.11 shows some
other possibilities. The last two hypocycloids have irrational values for

number of cusps, so they never return to their starting point. These are examples of what are known as space-filling

STUDENT PROJECT
The Witch of Agnesi
Many plane curves in mathematics are named after the people who first investigated them, like the folium of
Descartes or the spiral of Archimedes. However, perhaps the strangest name for a curve is the witch of Agnesi. Why a
witch?
Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718–1799) was one of the few recognized women mathematicians of eighteenth-century
Italy. She wrote a popular book on analytic geometry, published in 1748, which included an interesting curve that had
been studied by Fermat in 1630. The mathematician Guido Grandi showed in 1703 how to construct this curve, which
he later called the “versoria,” a Latin term for a rope used in sailing. Agnesi used the Italian term for this rope,
“versiera,” but in Latin, this same word means a “female goblin.” When Agnesi’s book was translated into English in
1801, the translator used the term “witch” for the curve, instead of rope. The name “witch of Agnesi” has stuck ever
since.
The witch of Agnesi is a curve defined as follows: Start with a circle of radius a so that the points
and
are
points on the circle (Figure 7.12). Let O denote the origin. Choose any other point A on the circle, and draw the secant
line OA. Let B denote the point at which the line OA intersects the horizontal line through
The vertical line
through B intersects the horizontal line through A at the point P. As the point A varies, the path that the point P
travels is the witch of Agnesi curve for the given circle.
Witch of Agnesi curves have applications in physics, including modeling water waves and distributions of spectral
lines. In probability theory, the curve describes the probability density function of the Cauchy distribution. In this
project you will parameterize these curves.

STUDENT PROJECT
Travels with My Ant: The Curtate and Prolate Cycloids
Earlier in this section, we looked at the parametric equations for a cycloid, which is the path a point on the edge of a
wheel traces as the wheel rolls along a straight path. In this project we look at two different variations of the cycloid,
called the curtate and prolate cycloids.
First, let’s revisit the derivation of the parametric equations for a cycloid. Recall that we considered a tenacious ant
trying to get home by hanging onto the edge of a bicycle tire. We have assumed the ant climbed onto the tire at the
very edge, where the tire touches the ground. As the wheel rolls, the ant moves with the edge of the tire (Figure 7.13).
As we have discussed, we have a lot of flexibility when parameterizing a curve. In this case we let our parameter t
represent the angle the tire has rotated through. Looking at Figure 7.13, we see that after the tire has rotated
through an angle of t, the position of the center of the wheel,
is given by

Furthermore, letting
denote the position of the ant, we note that
Then

*Figure 7.13 (a) The ant clings to the edge of the bicycle tire as the tire rolls along the ground. (b) Using geometry to*

determine the position of the ant after the tire has rotated through an angle of t.
Note that these are the same parametric representations we had before, but we have now assigned a physical
meaning to the parametric variable t.
After a while the ant is getting dizzy from going round and round on the edge of the tire. So he climbs up one of the
spokes toward the center of the wheel. By climbing toward the center of the wheel, the ant has changed his path of
motion. The new path has less up-and-down motion and is called a curtate cycloid (Figure 7.14). As shown in the
figure, we let b denote the distance along the spoke from the center of the wheel to the ant. As before, we let t
represent the angle the tire has rotated through. Additionally, we let
represent the position of the

On the basis of your answers to parts 1 and 2, what are the parametric equations representing the curtate
cycloid?
Once the ant’s head clears, he realizes that the bicyclist has made a turn, and is now traveling away from his
home. So he drops off the bicycle tire and looks around. Fortunately, there is a set of train tracks nearby, headed
back in the right direction. So the ant heads over to the train tracks to wait. After a while, a train goes by, heading
in the right direction, and he manages to jump up and just catch the edge of the train wheel (without getting
squished!).
The ant is still worried about getting dizzy, but the train wheel is slippery and has no spokes to climb, so he
decides to just hang on to the edge of the wheel and hope for the best. Now, train wheels have a flange to keep
the wheel running on the tracks. So, in this case, since the ant is hanging on to the very edge of the flange, the
distance from the center of the wheel to the ant is actually greater than the radius of the wheel (Figure 7.15).
The setup here is essentially the same as when the ant climbed up the spoke on the bicycle wheel. We let b
denote the distance from the center of the wheel to the ant, and we let t represent the angle the tire has rotated
through. Additionally, we let
represent the position of the center of the wheel and
represent the position of the ant (Figure 7.15).
When the distance from the center of the wheel to the ant is greater than the radius of the wheel, his path of
motion is called a prolate cycloid. A graph of a prolate cycloid is shown in the figure.

*Figure 7.15 (a) The ant is hanging onto the flange of the train wheel. (b) The new setup, now that the ant has*

Using the same approach you used in parts 1– 3, find the parametric equations for the path of motion of the ant.

What do you notice about your answer to part 3 and your answer to part 4?
Notice that the ant is actually traveling backward at times (the “loops” in the graph), even though the train
continues to move forward. He is probably going to be really dizzy by the time he gets home!

Another scenario: Suppose we would like to represent the location of a baseball after the ball leaves a pitcher’s hand. If
the position of the baseball is represented by the plane curve
then we should be able to use calculus to find
the speed of the ball at any given time. Furthermore, we should be able to calculate just how far that ball has traveled as
a function of time.
Derivatives of Parametric Equations
We start by asking how to calculate the slope of a line tangent to a parametric curve at a point. Consider the plane curve

□
Equation 7.1 can be used to calculate derivatives of plane curves, as well as critical points. Recall that a critical point of a

7.7
Find the area under the curve of the hypocycloid defined by the equations
Arc Length of a Parametric Curve
In addition to finding the area under a parametric curve, we sometimes need to find the arc length of a parametric
curve. In the case of a line segment, arc length is the same as the distance between the endpoints. If a particle travels
from point A to point B along a curve, then the distance that particle travels is the arc length. To develop a formula for
arc length, we start with an approximation by line segments as shown in the following graph.

*Figure 7.23 Approximation of a curve by line segments.*

Given a plane curve defined by the functions
we start by partitioning the interval
into
n equal subintervals:
The width of each subinterval is given by
We can
calculate the length of each line segment:
Then add these up. We let s denote the exact arc length and
denote the approximation by n line segments:

If we assume that
and

Applications of Derivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-introduction)) applies, so in each
subinterval
there exist

such that
Therefore Equation 7.4 becomes
This is a Riemann sum that approximates the arc length over a partition of the interval
If we further assume that
the derivatives are continuous and let the number of points in the partition increase without bound, the approximation
approaches the exact arc length. This gives

When taking the limit, the values of

are both contained within the same ever-shrinking interval of width
so
they must converge to the same value.

Arc Length of a Parametric Curve
Consider the plane curve defined by the parametric equations
and assume that

are differentiable functions of t. Then the arc length of this curve is given by
At this point a side derivation leads to a previous formula for arc length. In particular, suppose the parameter can be

We now return to the problem posed at the beginning of the section about a baseball leaving a pitcher’s hand. Ignoring
the effect of air resistance (unless it is a curve ball!), the ball travels a parabolic path. Assuming the pitcher’s hand is at
the origin and the ball travels left to right in the direction of the positive x-axis, the parametric equations for this curve
can be written as
where t represents time. We first calculate the distance the ball travels as a function of time. This distance is represented
by the arc length. We can modify the arc length formula slightly. First rewrite the functions
and
using v as an
independent variable, so as to eliminate any confusion with the parameter t:
Then we write the arc length formula as follows:
The variable v acts as a dummy variable that disappears after integration, leaving the arc length as a function of time t.
To integrate this expression we can use a formula from Appendix A,
We set

This function represents the distance traveled by the ball as a function of time. To calculate the speed, take the derivative
of this function with respect to t. While this may seem like a daunting task, it is possible to obtain the answer directly
from the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:

7.3.5 Identify symmetry in polar curves and equations.
The rectangular coordinate system (or Cartesian plane) provides a means of mapping points to ordered pairs and
ordered pairs to points. This is called a one-to-one mapping from points in the plane to ordered pairs. The polar
coordinate system provides an alternative method of mapping points to ordered pairs. In this section we see that in
some circumstances, polar coordinates can be more useful than rectangular coordinates.
Defining Polar Coordinates

has Cartesian
coordinates
The line segment connecting the origin to the point
measures the distance from the origin to
and has length
The angle between the positive
-axis and the line segment has measure
This observation suggests
a natural correspondence between the coordinate pair
and the values
and
This correspondence is the basis of
the polar coordinate system. Note that every point in the Cartesian plane has two values (hence the term ordered pair)
associated with it. In the polar coordinate system, each point also has two values associated with it:

positive, then measure the angle from the polar axis in a counterclockwise direction. If it is negative, then measure it
clockwise. If the value of

If the coefficient of

number of petals equals the coefficient. You are encouraged to explore why this happens. Even more interesting graphs
emerge when the coefficient of
is not an integer. For example, if it is rational, then the curve is closed; that is, it
eventually ends where it started (Figure 7.34(a)). However, if the coefficient is irrational, then the curve never closes
(Figure 7.34(b)). Although it may appear that the curve is closed, a closer examination reveals that the petals just above
the positive x axis are slightly thicker. This is because the petal does not quite match up with the starting point.

*Figure 7.34 Polar rose graphs of functions with (a) rational coefficient and (b) irrational coefficient. Note that the rose in*

part (b) does not fill the disk of radius 3 centered at the origin, even though it appears to. To see this, just note that for
any fixed ray from the origin, there are only a countable number of values of theta for which we get a point on the graph
along that ray. What we can say, though, is that for any point in the disk, there are points as close as you please to that
point on the given graph.

is cut away. It is possible to describe a spiral using rectangular coordinates. Figure 7.35 shows a spiral in rectangular

As the point P travels around the spiral in a counterclockwise direction, its distance d from the origin increases. Assume
that the distance d is a constant multiple k of the angle

7.4.1 Apply the formula for area of a region in polar coordinates.

In the rectangular coordinate system, the definite integral provides a way to calculate the area under a curve. In
particular, if we have a function
defined from
to
where
on this interval, the area between
the curve and the x-axis is given by
This fact, along with the formula for evaluating this integral, is
summarized in the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Similarly, the arc length of this curve is given by
In this section, we study analogous formulas for area and arc length in the polar coordinate
system.
Areas of Regions Bounded by Polar Curves
We have studied the formulas for area under a curve defined in rectangular coordinates and parametrically defined
curves. Now we turn our attention to deriving a formula for the area of a region bounded by a polar curve. Recall that
the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus used the concept of a Riemann sum to approximate the area under a
curve by using rectangles. For polar curves we use the Riemann sum again, but the rectangles are replaced by sectors of
a circle.
Consider a curve defined by the function
where
Our first step is to partition the interval
into n
equal-width subintervals. The width of each subinterval is given by the formula
and the ith partition
point
is given by the formula
Each partition point
defines a line with slope
passing through
the pole as shown in the following graph.

### 7.4 • Area and Arc Length in Polar Coordinates 583




*Figure 7.39 A partition of a typical curve in polar coordinates.*

The line segments are connected by arcs of constant radius. This defines sectors whose areas can be calculated by using
a geometric formula. The area of each sector is then used to approximate the area between successive line segments.
We then sum the areas of the sectors to approximate the total area. This approach gives a Riemann sum approximation
for the total area. The formula for the area of a sector of a circle is illustrated in the following figure.

*Figure 7.40 The area of a sector of a circle is given by*

Recall that the area of a circle is
When measuring angles in radians, 360 degrees is equal to
radians.
Therefore a fraction of a circle can be measured by the central angle
The fraction of the circle is given by
so the
area of the sector is this fraction multiplied by the total area:
Since the radius of a typical sector in Figure 7.39 is given by

However, in the graph there are
three intersection points. The third intersection point is the origin. The reason why this point did not show up as a

The solutions to this equation are of the form

7.5.1 Identify the equation of a parabola in standard form with given focus and directrix.
7.5.2 Identify the equation of an ellipse in standard form with given foci.
7.5.3 Identify the equation of a hyperbola in standard form with given foci.
7.5.4 Recognize a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola from its eccentricity value.
7.5.5 Write the polar equation of a conic section with eccentricity .
7.5.6 Identify when a general equation of degree two is a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola.
Conic sections have been studied since the time of the ancient Greeks, and were considered to be an important
mathematical concept. As early as 320 BCE, such Greek mathematicians as Menaechmus, Appollonius, and Archimedes
were fascinated by these curves. Appollonius wrote an entire eight-volume treatise on conic sections in which he was, for
example, able to derive a specific method for identifying a conic section through the use of geometry. Since then,
important applications of conic sections have arisen (for example, in astronomy), and the properties of conic sections are
used in radio telescopes, satellite dish receivers, and even architecture. In this section we discuss the three basic conic
sections, some of their properties, and their equations.
Conic sections get their name because they can be generated by intersecting a plane with a cone. A cone has two
identically shaped parts called nappes. One nappe is what most people mean by “cone,” having the shape of a party hat.

### 7.5 • Conic Sections 591



A right circular cone can be generated by revolving a line passing through the origin around the y-axis as shown.

*Figure 7.43 A cone generated by revolving the line*

around the
-axis.
Conic sections are generated by the intersection of a plane with a cone (Figure 7.44). If the plane intersects both nappes,
then the conic section is a hyperbola. If the plane is parallel to the generating line, the conic section is a parabola. If the
plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution, the conic section is a circle. If the plane intersects one nappe at an angle
to the axis (other than
then the conic section is an ellipse.

*Figure 7.44 The four conic sections. Each conic is determined by the angle the plane makes with the axis of the cone.*

Parabolas
A parabola is generated when a plane intersects a cone parallel to the generating line. In this case, the plane intersects
only one of the nappes. A parabola can also be defined in terms of distances.
Definition
A parabola is the set of all points whose distance from a fixed point, called the focus, is equal to the distance from a
fixed line, called the directrix. The point halfway between the focus and the directrix is called the vertex of the
parabola.
7 • Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

A graph of a typical parabola appears in Figure 7.45. Using this diagram in conjunction with the distance formula, we can
derive an equation for a parabola. Recall the distance formula: Given point P with coordinates
and point Q with
coordinates
the distance between them is given by the formula
Then from the definition of a parabola and Figure 7.45, we get
Squaring both sides and simplifying yields

*Figure 7.45 A typical parabola in which the distance from the focus to the vertex is represented by the variable*

Now suppose we want to relocate the vertex. We use the variables
to denote the coordinates of the vertex. Then if
the focus is directly above the vertex, it has coordinates
and the directrix has the equation
Going
through the same derivation yields the formula
Solving this equation for y leads to the following
theorem.

#### Theorem 7.8: 

Equations for Parabolas
Given a parabola opening upward with vertex located at
and focus located at
where p is a constant,
the equation for the parabola is given by
This is the standard form of a parabola.
We can also study the cases when the parabola opens down or to the left or the right. The equation for each of these
cases can also be written in standard form as shown in the following graphs.
(7.11)

### 7.5 • Conic Sections 593




*Figure 7.46 Four parabolas, opening in various directions, along with their equations in standard form.*

In addition, the equation of a parabola can be written in the general form, though in this form the values of h, k, and p
are not immediately recognizable. The general form of a parabola is written as
The first equation represents a parabola that opens either up or down. The second equation represents a parabola that
opens either to the left or to the right. To put the equation into standard form, use the method of completing the square.

#### Example 7.19: Converting the Equation of a Parabola from General into Standard Form

Put the equation
into standard form and graph the resulting parabola.

**Solution:**

Since y is not squared in this equation, we know that the parabola opens either upward or downward. Therefore we need
to solve this equation for y, which will put the equation into standard form. To do that, first add
to both sides of the
equation:

The next step is to complete the square on the right-hand side. Start by grouping the first two terms on the right-hand
side using parentheses:
Next determine the constant that, when added inside the parentheses, makes the quantity inside the parentheses a
perfect square trinomial. To do this, take half the coefficient of x and square it. This gives
Add 4 inside the
parentheses and subtract 4 outside the parentheses, so the value of the equation is not changed:

Put the equation
into standard form and graph the resulting parabola.
The axis of symmetry of a vertical (opening up or down) parabola is a vertical line passing through the vertex. The
parabola has an interesting reflective property. Suppose we have a satellite dish with a parabolic cross section. If a beam
of electromagnetic waves, such as light or radio waves, comes into the dish in a straight line from a satellite (parallel to
the axis of symmetry), then the waves reflect off the dish and collect at the focus of the parabola as shown.

### 7.5 • Conic Sections 595



Consider a parabolic dish designed to collect signals from a satellite in space. The dish is aimed directly at the satellite,
and a receiver is located at the focus of the parabola. Radio waves coming in from the satellite are reflected off the
surface of the parabola to the receiver, which collects and decodes the digital signals. This allows a small receiver to
gather signals from a wide angle of sky. Flashlights and headlights in a car work on the same principle, but in reverse:
the source of the light (that is, the light bulb) is located at the focus and the reflecting surface on the parabolic mirror
focuses the beam straight ahead. This allows a small light bulb to illuminate a wide angle of space in front of the
flashlight or car.
Ellipses
An ellipse can also be defined in terms of distances. In the case of an ellipse, there are two foci (plural of focus), and two
directrices (plural of directrix). We look at the directrices in more detail later in this section.
Definition
An ellipse is the set of all points for which the sum of their distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant.

*Figure 7.48 A typical ellipse in which the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is constant.*

A graph of a typical ellipse is shown in Figure 7.48. In this figure the foci are labeled as
and
Both are the same fixed
distance from the origin, and this distance is represented by the variable c. Therefore the coordinates of

horizontal or vertical. Thus, the length of the major axis in this ellipse is 2a. Furthermore,
and
are called the vertices
of the ellipse. The points
and
are located at the ends of the minor axis of the ellipse, and have coordinates
and
respectively. The minor axis is the shortest distance across the ellipse. The minor axis is perpendicular to the
major axis.
According to the definition of the ellipse, we can choose any point on the ellipse and the sum of the distances from this
point to the two foci is constant. Suppose we choose the point P. Since the coordinates of point P are
the sum of
the distances is
Therefore the sum of the distances from an arbitrary point A with coordinates
is also equal to 2a. Using the
distance formula, we get
Subtract the second radical from both sides and square both sides:
Now isolate the radical on the right-hand side and square again:
Isolate the variables on the left-hand side of the equation and the constants on the right-hand side:
Divide both sides by
This gives the equation
If we refer back to Figure 7.48, then the length of each of the two green line segments is equal to a. This is true because
the sum of the distances from the point Q to the foci
is equal to 2a, and the lengths of these two line segments
are equal. This line segment forms a right triangle with hypotenuse length a and leg lengths b and c. From the
Pythagorean theorem,
and
Therefore the equation of the ellipse becomes
Finally, if the center of the ellipse is moved from the origin to a point
we have the following standard form of an
ellipse.

#### Theorem 7.9: 

Equation of an Ellipse in Standard Form
Consider the ellipse with center
a horizontal major axis with length 2a, and a vertical minor axis with length 2b.
Then the equation of this ellipse in standard form is
and the foci are located at
where
The equations of the directrices are
If the major axis is vertical, then the equation of the ellipse becomes
and the foci are located at
where
The equations of the directrices in this case are
If the major axis is horizontal, then the ellipse is called horizontal, and if the major axis is vertical, then the ellipse is
called vertical. The equation of an ellipse is in general form if it is in the form
where A
and B are either both positive or both negative. To convert the equation from general to standard form, use the method
of completing the square.

#### Example 7.20: Finding the Standard Form of an Ellipse

Put the equation
into standard form and graph the resulting ellipse.

**Solution:**

First subtract 36 from both sides of the equation:
Next group the x terms together and the y terms together, and factor out the common factor:
We need to determine the constant that, when added inside each set of parentheses, results in a perfect square. In the
first set of parentheses, take half the coefficient of x and square it. This gives
In the second set of
parentheses, take half the coefficient of y and square it. This gives
Add these inside each pair of parentheses.
Since the first set of parentheses has a 9 in front, we are actually adding 36 to the left-hand side. Similarly, we are adding
36 to the second set as well. Therefore the equation becomes
Now factor both sets of parentheses and divide by 36:
The equation is now in standard form. Comparing this to Equation 7.14 gives

According to Kepler’s first law of planetary motion, the orbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one
of the foci as shown in Figure 7.50(a). Because Earth’s orbit is an ellipse, the distance from the Sun varies throughout the
year. A commonly held misconception is that Earth is closer to the Sun in the summer. In fact, in summer for the
northern hemisphere, Earth is farther from the Sun than during winter. The difference in season is caused by the tilt of
Earth’s axis in the orbital plane. Comets that orbit the Sun, such as Halley’s Comet, also have elliptical orbits, as do
moons orbiting the planets and satellites orbiting Earth.
Ellipses also have interesting reflective properties: A light ray emanating from one focus passes through the other focus
after mirror reflection in the ellipse. The same thing occurs with a sound wave as well. The National Statuary Hall in the
U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, is a famous room in an elliptical shape as shown in Figure 7.50(b). This hall served as the
meeting place for the U.S. House of Representatives for almost fifty years. The location of the two foci of this semielliptical room are clearly identified by marks on the floor, and even if the room is full of visitors, when two people stand
on these spots and speak to each other, they can hear each other much more clearly than they can hear someone
standing close by. Legend has it that John Quincy Adams had his desk located on one of the foci and was able to
eavesdrop on everyone else in the House without ever needing to stand. Although this makes a good story, it is unlikely
to be true, because the original ceiling produced so many echoes that the entire room had to be hung with carpets to
dampen the noise. The ceiling was rebuilt in 1902 and only then did the now-famous whispering effect emerge. Another
famous whispering gallery—the site of many marriage proposals—is in Grand Central Station in New York City.

whispering gallery with an elliptical cross section.
Hyperbolas
A hyperbola can also be defined in terms of distances. In the case of a hyperbola, there are two foci and two directrices.
Hyperbolas also have two asymptotes.

### 7.5 • Conic Sections 599



Definition
A hyperbola is the set of all points where the difference between their distances from two fixed points (the foci) is
constant.
A graph of a typical hyperbola appears as follows.

*Figure 7.51 A typical hyperbola in which the difference of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the foci is*

constant. The transverse axis is also called the major axis, and the conjugate axis is also called the minor axis.
The derivation of the equation of a hyperbola in standard form is virtually identical to that of an ellipse. One slight hitch
lies in the definition: The difference between two numbers is always positive. Let P be a point on the hyperbola with
coordinates
Then the definition of the hyperbola gives
To simplify the
derivation, assume that P is on the right branch of the hyperbola, so the absolute value bars drop. If it is on the left
branch, then the subtraction is reversed. The vertex of the right branch has coordinates
so
This equation is therefore true for any point on the hyperbola. Returning to the coordinates
for P:
Add the second radical from both sides and square both sides:
Now isolate the radical on the right-hand side and square again:

This is possible because
Therefore the equation of the ellipse becomes
Finally, if the center of the hyperbola is moved from the origin to the point
we have the following standard form of
a hyperbola.

ellipse is

then the hyperbola is called vertical. The equation of a hyperbola is in general form if it is in the form
where A and B have opposite signs. In order to convert the equation from general to
standard form, use the method of completing the square.

Add these inside each pair of
parentheses. Since the first set of parentheses has a 9 in front, we are actually adding 36 to the left-hand side. Similarly,
we are subtracting 16 from the second set of parentheses. Therefore the equation becomes

Hyperbolas also have interesting reflective properties. A ray directed toward one focus of a hyperbola is reflected by a
hyperbolic mirror toward the other focus. This concept is illustrated in the following figure.

*Figure 7.53 A hyperbolic mirror used to collect light from distant stars.*

This property of the hyperbola has important applications. It is used in radio direction finding (since the difference in
signals from two towers is constant along hyperbolas), and in the construction of mirrors inside telescopes (to reflect
light coming from the parabolic mirror to the eyepiece). Another interesting fact about hyperbolas is that for a comet
entering the solar system, if the speed is great enough to escape the Sun’s gravitational pull, then the path that the
comet takes as it passes through the solar system is hyperbolic.
Eccentricity and Directrix
An alternative way to describe a conic section involves the directrices, the foci, and a new property called eccentricity. We
will see that the value of the eccentricity of a conic section can uniquely define that conic.
Definition
The eccentricity e of a conic section is defined to be the distance from any point on the conic section to its focus,
divided by the perpendicular distance from that point to the nearest directrix. This value is constant for any conic
section, and can define the conic section as well:
1.
If
the conic is a parabola.
2.
If
it is an ellipse.
3.
If
it is a hyperbola.
The eccentricity of a circle is zero. The directrix of a conic section is the line that, together with the point known as the
focus, serves to define a conic section. Hyperbolas and noncircular ellipses have two foci and two associated
directrices. Parabolas have one focus and one directrix.
The three conic sections with their directrices appear in the following figure.

### 7.5 • Conic Sections 603




*Figure 7.54 The three conic sections with their foci and directrices.*

Recall from the definition of a parabola that the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the
distance from that same point to the directrix. Therefore, by definition, the eccentricity of a parabola must be 1. The
equations of the directrices of a horizontal ellipse are
The right vertex of the ellipse is located at
and the
right focus is
Therefore the distance from the vertex to the focus is
and the distance from the vertex to the
right directrix is
This gives the eccentricity as
Since
this step proves that the eccentricity of an ellipse is less than 1. The directrices of a horizontal hyperbola are
also located at
and a similar calculation shows that the eccentricity of a hyperbola is also
However in
this case we have
so the eccentricity of a hyperbola is greater than 1.

Polar Equations of Conic Sections
Sometimes it is useful to write or identify the equation of a conic section in polar form. To do this, we need the concept
of the focal parameter. The focal parameter of a conic section p is defined as the distance from a focus to the nearest
directrix. The following table gives the focal parameters for the different types of conics, where a is the length of the
semi-major axis (i.e., half the length of the major axis), c is the distance from the origin to the focus, and e is the

Table 7.1 Eccentricities and Focal Parameters
of the Conic Sections
Using the definitions of the focal parameter and eccentricity of the conic section, we can derive an equation for any conic
section in polar coordinates. In particular, we assume that one of the foci of a given conic section lies at the pole. Then
using the definition of the various conic sections in terms of distances, it is possible to prove the following theorem.

#### Theorem 7.11: 

Polar Equation of Conic Sections
The polar equation of a conic section with focal parameter p is given by
In the equation on the left, the major axis of the conic section is horizontal, and in the equation on the right, the major
axis is vertical. To work with a conic section written in polar form, first make the constant term in the denominator equal
to 1. This can be done by dividing both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the constant that appears
in front of the plus or minus in the denominator. Then the coefficient of the sine or cosine in the denominator is the
eccentricity. This value identifies the conic. If cosine appears in the denominator, then the conic is horizontal. If sine
appears, then the conic is vertical. If both appear then the axes are rotated. The center of the conic is not necessarily at
the origin. The center is at the origin only if the conic is a circle (i.e.,

#### Example 7.23: Graphing a Conic Section in Polar Coordinates

**Solution:**

The constant term in the denominator is 1, so the eccentricity of the conic is 2. This is a hyperbola. The focal parameter p
can be calculated by using the equation
Since
this gives
The cosine function appears in the
denominator, so the hyperbola is horizontal. Pick a few values for
and create a table of values. Then we can graph the
