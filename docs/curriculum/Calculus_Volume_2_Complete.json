          "content": "Introduction\nIceboats are a common sight on the lakes of Wisconsin and Minnesota on winter weekends. Iceboats are similar to\nsailboats, but they are fitted with runners, or “skates,” and are designed to run over the ice, rather than on water.\nIceboats can move very quickly, and many ice boating enthusiasts are drawn to the sport because of the speed. Top\niceboat racers can attain speeds up to five times the wind speed. If we know how fast an iceboat is moving, we can use\nintegration to determine how far it travels. We revisit this question later in the chapter (see Example 1.27).\nDetermining distance from velocity is just one of many applications of integration. In fact, integrals are used in a wide\nvariety of mechanical and physical applications. In this chapter, we first introduce the theory behind integration and use\n1 • Introduction\nintegrals to calculate areas. From there, we develop the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, which relates differentiation\nand integration. We then study some basic integration techniques and briefly examine some applications."

He used a process that has come to be known as the method of exhaustion, which used smaller and\nsmaller shapes, the areas of which could be calculated exactly, to fill an irregular region and thereby obtain closer and\ncloser approximations to the total area. In this process, an area bounded by curves is filled with rectangles, triangles,\nand shapes with exact area formulas. These areas are then summed to approximate the area of the curved region.\nIn this section, we develop techniques to approximate the area between a curve, defined by a function\nand the\nx-axis on a closed interval\nLike Archimedes, we first approximate the area under the curve using shapes of known\narea (namely, rectangles). By using smaller and smaller rectangles, we get closer and closer approximations to the area.\nTaking a limit allows us to calculate the exact area under the curve.\nLet’s start by introducing some notation to make the calculations easier. We then consider the case when\nis\ncontinuous and nonnegative. Later in the chapter, we relax some of these restrictions and develop techniques that apply\nin more general cases.\nSigma (Summation) Notation\nAs mentioned, we will use shapes of known area to approximate the area of an irregular region bounded by curves. This\nprocess often requires adding up long strings of numbers. To make it easier to write down these lengthy sums, we look\nat some new notation here, called sigma notation (also known as summation notation). The Greek capital letter\nsigma, is used to express long sums of values in a compact form. For example, if we want to add all the integers from 1\nto 20 without sigma notation, we have to write\nWe could probably skip writing a couple of terms and write\nwhich is better, but still cumbersome. With sigma notation, we write this sum as\nwhich is much more compact.\nTypically, sigma notation is presented in the form\nwhere\ndescribes the terms to be added, and the i is called the index. Each term is evaluated, then we sum all the\nvalues, beginning with the value when\nand ending with the value when\nFor example, an expression like\nis interpreted as\nNote that the index is used only to keep track of the terms to be\nadded; it does not factor into the calculation of the sum itself. The index is therefore called a dummy variable. We can\nuse any letter we like for the index. Typically, mathematicians use i, j, k, m, and n for indices.\nLet’s try a couple of examples of using sigma notation.\nEXAMPLE 1.1\nUsing Sigma Notation\na.\nWrite in sigma notation and evaluate the sum of terms\nfor\n1 • Integration\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nb.\nWrite the sum in sigma notation:\nSolution\na.\nWrite\nb.\nThe denominator of each term is a perfect square.

We required\nto be continuous and nonnegative. Unfortunately, realworld problems don’t always meet these restrictions. In this section, we look at how to apply the concept of the area\nunder the curve to a broader set of functions through the use of the definite integral.\nDefinition and Notation\nThe definite integral generalizes the concept of the area under a curve. We lift the requirements that\nbe continuous\nand nonnegative, and define the definite integral as follows.\nDefinition\nIf\nis a function defined on an interval\nthe definite integral of f from a to b is given by\nprovided the limit exists. If this limit exists, the function\nis said to be integrable on\nor is an integrable\nfunction.\nThe integral symbol in the previous definition should look familiar. We have seen similar notation in the chapter on\nApplications of Derivatives (http://openstax.org/books/calculus-volume-1/pages/4-introduction), where we used the\nindefinite integral symbol (without the a and b above and below) to represent an antiderivative. Although the notation\nfor indefinite integrals may look similar to the notation for a definite integral, they are not the same. A definite integral is\na number. An indefinite integral is a family of functions. Later in this chapter we examine how these concepts are related.\nHowever, close attention should always be paid to notation so we know whether we’re working with a definite integral or\nan indefinite integral.\nIntegral notation goes back to the late seventeenth century and is one of the contributions of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz,\nwho is often considered to be the codiscoverer of calculus, along with Isaac Newton. The integration symbol ∫ is an\nelongated S, suggesting sigma or summation. On a definite integral, above and below the summation symbol are the\nboundaries of the interval,\nThe numbers a and b are x-values and are called the limits of integration; specifically,\na is the lower limit and b is the upper limit. To clarify, we are using the word limit in two different ways in the context of\nthe definite integral. First, we talk about the limit of a sum as\n∞Second, the boundaries of the region are called the\nlimits of integration.\nWe call the function\nthe integrand, and the dx indicates that\nis a function with respect to x, called the\nvariable of integration. Note that, like the index in a sum, the variable of integration is a dummy variable, and has no\nimpact on the computation of the integral. We could use any variable we like as the variable of integration:\nPreviously, we discussed the fact that if\nis continuous on\nthen the limit\n∞\nexists and is\n∞\n(1.8)\n1 • Integration\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nunique. This leads to the following theorem, which we state without proof.\nTheorem 1.1\nContinuous Functions Are Integrable\nIf\nis continuous on\nthen f is integrable on\nFunctions that are not continuous on\nmay still be integrable, depending on the nature of the discontinuities. For\nexample, functions continuous on a closed interval, apart from a finite number of jump discontinuities, are integrable.\nIt is also worth noting here that we have retained the use of a regular partition in the Riemann sums. This restriction is\nnot strictly necessary. Any partition can be used to form a Riemann sum. However, if a nonregular partition is used to\ndefine the definite integral, it is not sufficient to take the limit as the number of subintervals goes to infinity. Instead, we\nmust take the limit as the width of the largest subinterval goes to zero. This introduces a little more complex notation in\nour limits and makes the calculations more difficult without really gaining much additional insight, so we stick with\nregular partitions for the Riemann sums.\nEXAMPLE 1.7\nEvaluating an Integral Using the Definition\nUse the definition of the definite integral to evaluate\nUse a right-endpoint approximation to generate the\nRiemann sum.\nSolution\nWe first want to set up a Riemann sum.

If she arches her back and points her belly\ntoward the ground, she reaches a terminal velocity of approximately 120 mph (176 ft/sec).

It says that when a quantity changes, the new value\nequals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change of that quantity. The formula can be expressed in two ways.\nThe second is more familiar; it is simply the definite integral.\nTheorem 1.6\nNet Change Theorem\nThe new value of a changing quantity equals the initial value plus the integral of the rate of change:\nSubtracting\nfrom both sides of the first equation yields the second equation. Since they are equivalent formulas,\nwhich one we use depends on the application.\nThe significance of the net change theorem lies in the results. Net change can be applied to area, distance, and volume,\nto name only a few applications. Net change accounts for negative quantities automatically without having to write more\nthan one integral. To illustrate, let’s apply the net change theorem to a velocity function in which the result is\ndisplacement.\nWe looked at a simple example of this in The Definite Integral. Suppose a car is moving due north (the positive direction)\nat 40 mph between 2 p.m. and 4 p.m., then the car moves south at 30 mph between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. We can graph this\nmotion as shown in Figure 1.32.\nFigure 1.32 The graph shows speed versus time for the given motion of a car.\nJust as we did before, we can use definite integrals to calculate the net displacement as well as the total distance\ntraveled.

In this section, we use definite\nintegrals to find volumes of three-dimensional solids. We consider three approaches—slicing, disks, and washers—for\nfinding these volumes, depending on the characteristics of the solid.\nVolume and the Slicing Method\nJust as area is the numerical measure of a two-dimensional region, volume is the numerical measure of a threedimensional solid. Most of us have computed volumes of solids by using basic geometric formulas. The volume of a\nrectangular solid, for example, can be computed by multiplying length, width, and height:\nThe formulas for the\nvolume of a sphere\na cone\nand a pyramid\nhave also been introduced.\nAlthough some of these formulas were derived using geometry alone, all these formulas can be obtained by using\nintegration.\nWe can also calculate the volume of a cylinder. Although most of us think of a cylinder as having a circular base, such as a\nsoup can or a metal rod, in mathematics the word cylinder has a more general meaning. To discuss cylinders in this\nmore general context, we first need to define some vocabulary.\nWe define the cross-section of a solid to be the intersection of a plane with the solid. A cylinder is defined as any solid\nthat can be generated by translating a plane region along a line perpendicular to the region, called the axis of the\ncylinder. Thus, all cross-sections perpendicular to the axis of a cylinder are identical. The solid shown in Figure 2.11 is an\nexample of a cylinder with a noncircular base. To calculate the volume of a cylinder, then, we simply multiply the area of\nthe cross-section by the height of the cylinder:\nIn the case of a right circular cylinder (soup can), this becomes"

When a force moves an object, we say the force does work on the object. In other words, work can be thought of\nas the amount of energy it takes to move an object. According to physics, when we have a constant force, work can be\nexpressed as the product of force and distance.\nIn the English system, the unit of force is the pound and the unit of distance is the foot, so work is given in foot-pounds.\nIn the metric system, kilograms and meters are used. One newton is the force needed to accelerate\nkilogram of mass\nat the rate of\nm/sec2. Thus, the most common unit of work is the newton-meter. This same unit is also called the joule.\nBoth are defined as kilograms times meters squared over seconds squared\nWhen we have a constant force, things are pretty easy. It is rare, however, for a force to be constant. The work done to\ncompress (or elongate) a spring, for example, varies depending on how far the spring has already been compressed (or\nstretched). We look at springs in more detail later in this section.\nSuppose we have a variable force\nthat moves an object in a positive direction along the x-axis from point\nto point\nTo calculate the work done, we partition the interval\nand estimate the work done over each subinterval. So, for\nlet\nbe a regular partition of the interval\nand for\nchoose an arbitrary point\nTo calculate the work done to move an object from point\nto point\nwe assume the force is\nroughly constant over the interval, and use\nto approximate the force.

Although in the real world we\nwould have to account for the force of friction between the block and the surface on which it is resting, we ignore friction\nhere and assume the block is resting on a frictionless surface. When the spring is at its natural length (at rest), the\nsystem is said to be at equilibrium. In this state, the spring is neither elongated nor compressed, and in this equilibrium\nposition the block does not move until some force is introduced.

In\naddition, instead of being concerned about the work done to move a single mass, we are looking at the work done to\nmove a volume of water, and it takes more work to move the water from the bottom of the tank than it does to move the\nwater from the top of the tank.\nWe examine the process in the context of a cylindrical tank, then look at a couple of examples using tanks of different\nshapes.

In the English system,\nforce is measured in pounds. In the metric system, it is measured in newtons. Pressure is force per unit area, so in the\nEnglish system we have pounds per square foot (or, perhaps more commonly, pounds per square inch, denoted psi). In\nthe metric system we have newtons per square meter, also called pascals.\nLet’s begin with the simple case of a plate of area\nsubmerged horizontally in water at a depth s (Figure 2.56). Then, the\nforce exerted on the plate is simply the weight of the water above it, which is given by\nwhere\nis the weight\ndensity of water (weight per unit volume). To find the hydrostatic pressure—that is, the pressure exerted by water on a\nsubmerged object—we divide the force by the area. So the pressure is\n2 • Applications of Integration\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 2.56 A plate submerged horizontally in water.\nBy Pascal’s principle, the pressure at a given depth is the same in all directions, so it does not matter if the plate is\nsubmerged horizontally or vertically. So, as long as we know the depth, we know the pressure. We can apply Pascal’s\nprinciple to find the force exerted on surfaces, such as dams, that are oriented vertically. We cannot apply the formula\ndirectly, because the depth varies from point to point on a vertically oriented surface. So, as we have done\nmany times before, we form a partition, a Riemann sum, and, ultimately, a definite integral to calculate the force.\nSuppose a thin plate is submerged in water.

The basic\nidea of the center of mass is the notion of a balancing point. Many of us have seen performers who spin plates on the\nends of sticks. The performers try to keep several of them spinning without allowing any of them to drop. If we look at a\nsingle plate (without spinning it), there is a sweet spot on the plate where it balances perfectly on the stick. If we put the\nstick anywhere other than that sweet spot, the plate does not balance and it falls to the ground. (That is why performers\nspin the plates; the spin helps keep the plates from falling even if the stick is not exactly in the right place.)\nMathematically, that sweet spot is called the center of mass of the plate.\nIn this section, we first examine these concepts in a one-dimensional context, then expand our development to consider\ncenters of mass of two-dimensional regions and symmetry.

On a seesaw, if one child sits at each end, the heavier\nchild sinks down and the lighter child is lifted into the air. If the heavier child slides in toward the center, though, the\nseesaw balances.

For our purposes, we assume the sheet is thin enough that it can be treated as if it is twodimensional. Such a sheet is called a lamina. Next we develop techniques to find the center of mass of a lamina. In this\nsection, we also assume the density of the lamina is constant.\nLaminas are often represented by a two-dimensional region in a plane. The geometric center of such a region is called its\ncentroid. Since we have assumed the density of the lamina is constant, the center of mass of the lamina depends only\non the shape of the corresponding region in the plane; it does not depend on the density. In this case, the center of\nmass of the lamina corresponds to the centroid of the delineated region in the plane. As with systems of point masses,\nwe need to find the total mass of the lamina, as well as the moments of the lamina with respect to the x- and y-axes.\nWe first consider a lamina in the shape of a rectangle. Recall that the center of mass of a lamina is the point where the\nlamina balances. For a rectangle, that point is both the horizontal and vertical center of the rectangle.

This engineering marvel is a horseshoe-shaped\nobservation platform suspended 4000 ft above the Colorado River on the West Rim of the Grand Canyon. Its crystalclear glass floor allows stunning views of the canyon below (see the following figure).\nFigure 2.72 The Grand Canyon Skywalk offers magnificent views of the canyon. (credit: 10da_ralta, Wikimedia\nCommons)\nThe Skywalk is a cantilever design, meaning that the observation platform extends over the rim of the canyon, with\nno visible means of support below it. Despite the lack of visible support posts or struts, cantilever structures are\nengineered to be very stable and the Skywalk is no exception. The observation platform is attached firmly to support\nposts that extend 46 ft down into bedrock. The structure was built to withstand 100-mph winds and an 8.0-magnitude\nearthquake within 50 mi, and is capable of supporting more than 70,000,000 lb.\nOne factor affecting the stability of the Skywalk is the center of gravity of the structure. We are going to calculate the\ncenter of gravity of the Skywalk, and examine how the center of gravity changes when tourists walk out onto the\nobservation platform.\nThe observation platform is U-shaped. The legs of the U are 10 ft wide and begin on land, under the visitors’ center,\n48 ft from the edge of the canyon. The platform extends 70 ft over the edge of the canyon.\nTo calculate the center of mass of the structure, we treat it as a lamina and use a two-dimensional region in the\nxy-plane to represent the platform. We begin by dividing the region into three subregions so we can consider each\nsubregion separately. The first region, denoted\nconsists of the curved part of the U. We model\nas a\nsemicircular annulus, with inner radius 25 ft and outer radius 35 ft, centered at the origin (see the following figure).\n2 • Applications of Integration\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 2.73 We model the Skywalk with three sub-regions.\nThe legs of the platform, extending 35 ft between\nand the canyon wall, comprise the second sub-region,\nLast,\nthe ends of the legs, which extend 48 ft under the visitor center, comprise the third sub-region,\nAssume the\ndensity of the lamina is constant and assume the total weight of the platform is 1,200,000 lb (not including the weight\nof the visitor center; we will consider that later).

If all 800 people were allowed on the platform,\nand all of them went to the farthest end of the platform, how would the center of gravity of the system be\naffected?

In addition, a careful examination of Figure 3.15 leads us to make the following observations about using\nthe trapezoidal rules and midpoint rules to estimate the definite integral of a nonnegative function. The trapezoidal rule\ntends to overestimate the value of a definite integral systematically over intervals where the function is concave up and\nto underestimate the value of a definite integral systematically over intervals where the function is concave down. On the\nother hand, the midpoint rule tends to average out these errors somewhat by partially overestimating and partially\nunderestimating the value of the definite integral over these same types of intervals. This leads us to hypothesize that, in\ngeneral, the midpoint rule tends to be more accurate than the trapezoidal rule.\nFigure 3.15 The trapezoidal rule tends to be less accurate than the midpoint rule.\n(3.11)"

We saw this in an earlier\nchapter in the section on exponential growth and decay, which is the simplest model. A more realistic model includes\nother factors that affect the growth of the population. In this section, we study the logistic differential equation and see\nhow it applies to the study of population dynamics in the context of biology.\nPopulation Growth and Carrying Capacity\nTo model population growth using a differential equation, we first need to introduce some variables and relevant terms.\nThe variable\nwill represent time. The units of time can be hours, days, weeks, months, or even years. Any given\nproblem must specify the units used in that particular problem. The variable\nwill represent population. Since the\npopulation varies over time, it is understood to be a function of time. Therefore we use the notation\nfor the\npopulation as a function of time. If\nis a differentiable function, then the first derivative\nrepresents the\ninstantaneous rate of change of the population as a function of time.\nIn Exponential Growth and Decay, we studied the exponential growth and decay of populations and radioactive\nsubstances. An example of an exponential growth function is\nIn this function,\nrepresents the\npopulation at time\nrepresents the initial population (population at time\nand the constant\nis called the\ngrowth rate. Figure 4.18 shows a graph of\nHere\nand\nFigure 4.18 An exponential growth model of population.\nWe can verify that the function\nsatisfies the initial-value problem\nThis differential equation has an interesting interpretation. The left-hand side represents the rate at which the\npopulation increases (or decreases). The right-hand side is equal to a positive constant multiplied by the current\npopulation. Therefore the differential equation states that the rate at which the population increases is proportional to\nthe population at that point in time. Furthermore, it states that the constant of proportionality never changes.\n4 • Introduction to Differential Equations\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nOne problem with this function is its prediction that as time goes on, the population grows without bound. This is\nunrealistic in a real-world setting. Various factors limit the rate of growth of a particular population, including birth rate,\ndeath rate, food supply, predators, and so on. The growth constant\nusually takes into consideration the birth and death\nrates but none of the other factors, and it can be interpreted as a net (birth minus death) percent growth rate per unit\ntime. A natural question to ask is whether the population growth rate stays constant, or whether it changes over time.\nBiologists have found that in many biological systems, the population grows until a certain steady-state population is\nreached. This possibility is not taken into account with exponential growth. However, the concept of carrying capacity\nallows for the possibility that in a given area, only a certain number of a given organism or animal can thrive without\nrunning into resource issues.\nDefinition\nThe carrying capacity of an organism in a given environment is defined to be the maximum population of that\norganism that the environment can sustain indefinitely.\nWe use the variable\nto denote the carrying capacity. The growth rate is represented by the variable\nUsing these\nvariables, we can define the logistic differential equation.\nDefinition\nLet\nrepresent the carrying capacity for a particular organism in a given environment, and let\nbe a real number\nthat represents the growth rate.

Consequently, we\ncan express its area as a sum of infinitely many terms. How do we add an infinite number of terms? Can a sum of an\ninfinite number of terms be finite? To answer these questions, we need to introduce the concept of an infinite series, a\nsum with infinitely many terms. Having defined the necessary tools, we will be able to calculate the area of the Koch\nsnowflake (see Example 5.8).\nThe topic of infinite series may seem unrelated to differential and integral calculus. In fact, an infinite series whose terms\ninvolve powers of a variable is a powerful tool that we can use to express functions as “infinite polynomials.” We can use\ninfinite series to evaluate complicated functions, approximate definite integrals, and create new functions.

If you add these terms together, you get a series. In this\nsection we define an infinite series and show how series are related to sequences. We also define what it means for a\nseries to converge or diverge. We introduce one of the most important types of series: the geometric series. We will use\ngeometric series in the next chapter to write certain functions as polynomials with an infinite number of terms. This\nprocess is important because it allows us to evaluate, differentiate, and integrate complicated functions by using\npolynomials that are easier to handle. We also discuss the harmonic series, arguably the most interesting divergent\nseries because it just fails to converge.\nSums and Series\nAn infinite series is a sum of infinitely many terms and is written in the form\n∞\nBut what does this mean? We cannot add an infinite number of terms in the same way we can add a finite number of\nterms. Instead, the value of an infinite series is defined in terms of the limit of partial sums. A partial sum of an infinite\nseries is a finite sum of the form\nTo see how we use partial sums to evaluate infinite series, consider the following example.

For example, you might have the option of receiving 20 million\ndollars today or receiving 1.5 million dollars each year for the next 20 years. Which is the better deal? Certainly 1.5\nmillion dollars over 20 years is equivalent to 30 million dollars. However, receiving the 20 million dollars today would\nallow you to invest the money.\nAlternatively, what if you were guaranteed to receive 1 million dollars every year indefinitely (extending to your heirs) or\nreceive 20 million dollars today. Which would be the better deal? To answer these questions, you need to know how to\nuse infinite series to calculate the value of periodic payments over time in terms of today’s dollars (see Example 6.7).\nAn infinite series of the form\n∞\nis known as a power series. Since the terms contain the variable x, power series\ncan be used to define functions.

The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand\nhow those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. Due to the comprehensive nature of the material,\nwe are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 2 covers integration, differential\nequations, sequences and series, and parametric equations and polar coordinates.\nCoverage and Scope\nOur Calculus Volume 2 textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general calculus courses nationwide. We\nhave worked to make calculus interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent\nin the subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of Calculus have been developed and\narranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students\nhave already learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of\neach section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but work with them in ways that will be useful in later\ncourses and future careers. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from\nmathematics educators dedicated to the project.\nVolume 1\n•\nChapter 1: Functions and Graphs\n•\nChapter 2: Limits\n•\nChapter 3: Derivatives\n•\nChapter 4: Applications of Derivatives\nPreface\n•\nChapter 5: Integration\n•\nChapter 6: Applications of Integration\nVolume 2\n•\nChapter 1: Integration\n•\nChapter 2: Applications of Integration\n•\nChapter 3: Techniques of Integration\n•\nChapter 4: Introduction to Differential Equations\n•\nChapter 5: Sequences and Series\n•\nChapter 6: Power Series\n•\nChapter 7: Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates\nVolume 3\n•\nChapter 1: Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates\n•\nChapter 2: Vectors in Space\n•\nChapter 3: Vector-Valued Functions\n•\nChapter 4: Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables\n•\nChapter 5: Multiple Integration\n•\nChapter 6: Vector Calculus\n•\nChapter 7: Second-Order Differential Equations\nPedagogical Foundation\nThroughout Calculus Volume 2 you will find examples and exercises that present classical ideas and techniques as well as\nmodern applications and methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom experience on the part\nof long-time calculus professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students.\nMotivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology, ecology, business, and economics, as well as\nareas of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. Student Projects in each chapter give students\nopportunities to explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied mathematics, from showing that the number e is\nirrational, to calculating the center of mass of the Grand Canyon Skywalk or the terminal speed of a skydiver. Chapter\nOpening Applications pose problems that are solved later in the chapter, using the ideas covered in that chapter.\nProblems include the hydraulic force against the Hoover Dam, and the comparison of the relative intensity of two\nearthquakes. Definitions, Rules, and Theorems are highlighted throughout the text, including over 60 Proofs of\ntheorems.\nAssessments That Reinforce Key Concepts\nIn-chapter Examples walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking\nstudents to practice the skill with a “Check Your Learning” component. The book also includes assessments at the end of\neach chapter so students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems. Many exercises are marked with a\n[T] to indicate they are suitable for solution by technology, including calculators or Computer Algebra Systems (CAS).\nAnswers for selected exercises are available in the Answer Key at the back of the book.\nEarly or Late Transcendentals\nCalculus Volume 2 is designed to accommodate both Early and Late Transcendental approaches to calculus. Exponential\nand logarithmic functions are presented in Chapter 2. Integration of these functions is covered in Chapters 1 for\ninstructors who want to include them with other types of functions. These discussions, however, are in separate sections\nthat can be skipped for instructors who prefer to wait until the integral definitions are given before teaching the calculus\nderivations of exponentials and logarithms.\nComprehensive Art Program\nOur art program is designed to enhance students’ understanding of concepts through clear and effective illustrations,\ndiagrams, and photographs.\nPreface\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nAnswers to Questions in the Book\nAnswers to Examples are provided just below the question in the book.

The polar coordinate system is well suited for describing curves of this type. How\ncan we use this coordinate system to describe spirals and other radial figures? (See Example 7.14.)\nIn this chapter we also study parametric equations, which give us a convenient way to describe curves, or to study the\nposition of a particle or object in two dimensions as a function of time. We will use parametric equations and polar\ncoordinates for describing many topics later in this text."

In the two-dimensional coordinate system,\nparametric equations are useful for describing curves that are not necessarily functions. The parameter is an\nindependent variable that both x and y depend on, and as the parameter increases, the values of x and y trace out a path\nalong a plane curve. For example, if the parameter is t (a common choice), then t might represent time. Then x and y are\ndefined as functions of time, and\ncan describe the position in the plane of a given object as it moves along a\ncurved path.\nParametric Equations and Their Graphs\nConsider the orbit of Earth around the Sun. Our year lasts approximately 365.25 days, but for this discussion we will use\n365 days. On January 1 of each year, the physical location of Earth with respect to the Sun is nearly the same, except for\nleap years, when the lag introduced by the extra\nday of orbiting time is built into the calendar. We call January 1 “day 1”\nof the year. Then, for example, day 31 is January 31, day 59 is February 28, and so on.\nThe number of the day in a year can be considered a variable that determines Earth’s position in its orbit. As Earth\nrevolves around the Sun, its physical location changes relative to the Sun. After one full year, we are back where we\nstarted, and a new year begins. According to Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, the shape of the orbit is elliptical, with\nthe Sun at one focus of the ellipse. We study this idea in more detail in Conic Sections.\nFigure 7.2 Earth’s orbit around the Sun in one year.\nFigure 7.2 depicts Earth’s orbit around the Sun during one year. The point labeled\nis one of the foci of the ellipse; the\nother focus is occupied by the Sun. If we superimpose coordinate axes over this graph, then we can assign ordered pairs\nto each point on the ellipse (Figure 7.3). Then each x value on the graph is a value of position as a function of time, and\neach y value is also a value of position as a function of time. Therefore, each point on the graph corresponds to a value\nof Earth’s position as a function of time.\n7 • Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFigure 7.3 Coordinate axes superimposed on the orbit of Earth.\nWe can determine the functions for\nand\nthereby parameterizing the orbit of Earth around the Sun.

The set of points\nobtained as t varies over the\ninterval I is called the graph of the parametric equations.

The process is known as parameterization of a curve.\nEXAMPLE 7.3\nParameterizing a Curve\nFind two different pairs of parametric equations to represent the graph of\nSolution\nFirst, it is always possible to parameterize a curve by defining\nthen replacing x with t in the equation for\nThis gives the parameterization\nSince there is no restriction on the domain in the original graph, there is no restriction on the values of t.\nWe have complete freedom in the choice for the second parameterization.

The tires stay in contact with the road and rotate in a predictable\npattern. Now suppose a very determined ant is tired after a long day and wants to get home. So he hangs onto the side\nof the tire and gets a free ride. The path that this ant travels down a straight road is called a cycloid (Figure 7.9). A cycloid\ngenerated by a circle (or bicycle wheel) of radius a is given by the parametric equations\nTo see why this is true, consider the path that the center of the wheel takes. The center moves along the x-axis at a\nconstant height equal to the radius of the wheel. If the radius is a, then the coordinates of the center can be given by the\nequations\nfor any value of\nNext, consider the ant, which rotates around the center along a circular path. If the bicycle is moving\nfrom left to right then the wheels are rotating in a clockwise direction. A possible parameterization of the circular motion\nof the ant (relative to the center of the wheel) is given by\n(The negative sign is needed to reverse the orientation of the curve. If the negative sign were not there, we would have\nto imagine the wheel rotating counterclockwise.) Adding these equations together gives the equations for the cycloid.\nFigure 7.9 A wheel traveling along a road without slipping; the point on the edge of the wheel traces out a cycloid.\nNow suppose that the bicycle wheel doesn’t travel along a straight road but instead moves along the inside of a larger\nwheel, as in Figure 7.10. In this graph, the green circle is traveling around the blue circle in a counterclockwise direction.\nA point on the edge of the green circle traces out the red graph, which is called a hypocycloid."

However, perhaps the strangest name for a curve is the witch of Agnesi. Why a\nwitch?\nMaria Gaetana Agnesi (1718–1799) was one of the few recognized women mathematicians of eighteenth-century\nItaly. She wrote a popular book on analytic geometry, published in 1748, which included an interesting curve that had\nbeen studied by Fermat in 1630. The mathematician Guido Grandi showed in 1703 how to construct this curve, which\nhe later called the “versoria,” a Latin term for a rope used in sailing. Agnesi used the Italian term for this rope,\n“versiera,” but in Latin, this same word means a “female goblin.” When Agnesi’s book was translated into English in\n1801, the translator used the term “witch” for the curve, instead of rope. The name “witch of Agnesi” has stuck ever\nsince.\nThe witch of Agnesi is a curve defined as follows: Start with a circle of radius a so that the points\nand\nare\npoints on the circle (Figure 7.12). Let O denote the origin. Choose any other point A on the circle, and draw the secant\nline OA. Let B denote the point at which the line OA intersects the horizontal line through\nThe vertical line\nthrough B intersects the horizontal line through A at the point P. As the point A varies, the path that the point P\ntravels is the witch of Agnesi curve for the given circle.\nWitch of Agnesi curves have applications in physics, including modeling water waves and distributions of spectral\nlines. In probability theory, the curve describes the probability density function of the Cauchy distribution. In this\nproject you will parameterize these curves."

In this project we look at two different variations of the cycloid,\ncalled the curtate and prolate cycloids.\nFirst, let’s revisit the derivation of the parametric equations for a cycloid. Recall that we considered a tenacious ant\ntrying to get home by hanging onto the edge of a bicycle tire. We have assumed the ant climbed onto the tire at the\nvery edge, where the tire touches the ground. As the wheel rolls, the ant moves with the edge of the tire (Figure 7.13).\nAs we have discussed, we have a lot of flexibility when parameterizing a curve. In this case we let our parameter t\nrepresent the angle the tire has rotated through. Looking at Figure 7.13, we see that after the tire has rotated\nthrough an angle of t, the position of the center of the wheel,\nis given by\n7 • Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates\nAccess for free at openstax.org\nFurthermore, letting\ndenote the position of the ant, we note that\nThen\nFigure 7.13 (a) The ant clings to the edge of the bicycle tire as the tire rolls along the ground. (b) Using geometry to\ndetermine the position of the ant after the tire has rotated through an angle of t.\nNote that these are the same parametric representations we had before, but we have now assigned a physical\nmeaning to the parametric variable t.\nAfter a while the ant is getting dizzy from going round and round on the edge of the tire. So he climbs up one of the\nspokes toward the center of the wheel. By climbing toward the center of the wheel, the ant has changed his path of\nmotion. The new path has less up-and-down motion and is called a curtate cycloid (Figure 7.14). As shown in the\nfigure, we let b denote the distance along the spoke from the center of the wheel to the ant. As before, we let t\nrepresent the angle the tire has rotated through. Additionally, we let\nrepresent the position of the\ncenter of the wheel and\nrepresent the position of the ant.\nFigure 7.14 (a) The ant climbs up one of the spokes toward the center of the wheel.

So he drops off the bicycle tire and looks around. Fortunately, there is a set of train tracks nearby, headed\nback in the right direction. So the ant heads over to the train tracks to wait. After a while, a train goes by, heading\nin the right direction, and he manages to jump up and just catch the edge of the train wheel (without getting\nsquished!).\nThe ant is still worried about getting dizzy, but the train wheel is slippery and has no spokes to climb, so he\ndecides to just hang on to the edge of the wheel and hope for the best. Now, train wheels have a flange to keep\nthe wheel running on the tracks. So, in this case, since the ant is hanging on to the very edge of the flange, the\ndistance from the center of the wheel to the ant is actually greater than the radius of the wheel (Figure 7.15).\nThe setup here is essentially the same as when the ant climbed up the spoke on the bicycle wheel. We let b\ndenote the distance from the center of the wheel to the ant, and we let t represent the angle the tire has rotated\nthrough. Additionally, we let\nrepresent the position of the center of the wheel and\nrepresent the position of the ant (Figure 7.15).\nWhen the distance from the center of the wheel to the ant is greater than the radius of the wheel, his path of\nmotion is called a prolate cycloid.

Because Earth’s orbit is an ellipse, the distance from the Sun varies throughout the\nyear. A commonly held misconception is that Earth is closer to the Sun in the summer. In fact, in summer for the\nnorthern hemisphere, Earth is farther from the Sun than during winter. The difference in season is caused by the tilt of\nEarth’s axis in the orbital plane. Comets that orbit the Sun, such as Halley’s Comet, also have elliptical orbits, as do\nmoons orbiting the planets and satellites orbiting Earth.\nEllipses also have interesting reflective properties: A light ray emanating from one focus passes through the other focus\nafter mirror reflection in the ellipse. The same thing occurs with a sound wave as well. The National Statuary Hall in the\nU.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, is a famous room in an elliptical shape as shown in Figure 7.50(b). This hall served as the\nmeeting place for the U.S. House of Representatives for almost fifty years. The location of the two foci of this semielliptical room are clearly identified by marks on the floor, and even if the room is full of visitors, when two people stand\non these spots and speak to each other, they can hear each other much more clearly than they can hear someone\nstanding close by. Legend has it that John Quincy Adams had his desk located on one of the foci and was able to\neavesdrop on everyone else in the House without ever needing to stand. Although this makes a good story, it is unlikely\nto be true, because the original ceiling produced so many echoes that the entire room had to be hung with carpets to\ndampen the noise. The ceiling was rebuilt in 1902 and only then did the now-famous whispering effect emerge. Another\nfamous whispering gallery—the site of many marriage proposals—is in Grand Central Station in New York City.\nFigure 7.50 (a) Earth’s orbit around the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.

Then\nusing the definition of the various conic sections in terms of distances, it is possible to prove the following theorem.\nTheorem 7.11\nPolar Equation of Conic Sections\nThe polar equation of a conic section with focal parameter p is given by\nIn the equation on the left, the major axis of the conic section is horizontal, and in the equation on the right, the major\naxis is vertical. To work with a conic section written in polar form, first make the constant term in the denominator equal\nto 1. This can be done by dividing both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the constant that appears\nin front of the plus or minus in the denominator. Then the coefficient of the sine or cosine in the denominator is the\neccentricity. This value identifies the conic. If cosine appears in the denominator, then the conic is horizontal. If sine\nappears, then the conic is vertical. If both appear then the axes are rotated. The center of the conic is not necessarily at\nthe origin. The center is at the origin only if the conic is a circle (i.e.,\nEXAMPLE 7.23\nGraphing a Conic Section in Polar Coordinates\nIdentify and create a graph of the conic section described by the equation\nSolution\nThe constant term in the denominator is 1, so the eccentricity of the conic is 2. This is a hyperbola. The focal parameter p\ncan be calculated by using the equation\nSince\nthis gives\nThe cosine function appears in the\ndenominator, so the hyperbola is horizontal. Pick a few values for\nand create a table of values. Then we can graph the\nhyperbola (Figure 7.55).\n−3"
